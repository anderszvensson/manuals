<title>How to use this manual</title>

<indexterm><primary>manuals</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Far from being complete in exploring the possibilities of each
single software, you'll get introduced and find basic directions on
how to use, modify and employ dynebolic in various circumstances.
</para>

<para>
When in need of in-deep information on how to operate a particular
software, you should consult the included <emphasis>man pages</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
The manpage is the name of the manual page describing usage of the
program, you can use it with the <emphasis>man</emphasis> command from
an <emphasis>XTerminal</emphasis> inside dyne:bolic :
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>man hasciicam</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
it will show an higly informative text about the usage of the program;
the manpage name usually matches the name of the program executable
itself.
</para>

<para>
Always keep in mind: the <emphasis>man</emphasis> command is your
friend :) it works in every GNU/Linux system providing information
about every command, and with all the commands that are around there
is a lot to discover! for example have a look at manuals like "sox"
or "convert", you'll find out that you can do a lot of things just
from the XTerminal commandline!
</para>


<para>
At last, in case you are using intensively a certain software for
your purposes, don't miss to consult its own documentation and join
the community of users around it: there you can discover more about its
usage and development.

 <para> Jah Rastafari Livity
bless our Freedom!  This is free software, share it for the good of
yourself and your people, respect others and let them express, be free
and let others be free.  Live long and prosper in Peace!
</para>

<para>
But, no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance inna babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of applications for production and not only
fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio, you don't need to buy
anything to express your voice.
Freedom and sharing of knowledge are solid principles for evolution and that's
where this software comes from.
</para>

<para>
Inna babylon, money is the main requirement to make a voice possible to
be heard by others. Capitalist and fundamentalist governments all around
the world rule with huge TV monopolies spreading their propaganda,
silencing all criticism.
</para>

<para>

This is a struggle for Redemption from existing operating systems
which always require new expensive hardware for doing the same as
ever: give us free players but make us pay for producing our own
voices. And the one who protects you rips you off, as the Arabs say.

</para>

<para>
Dyne:bolic is a tool to produce and publish yourself, freely.
There is nothing to consume here, there is all you need to create.
</para>

<para>

Commercial operating systems always give a possibility to listen - all
kinds of "free to download" players, but always with restrictions and
no easy way for everybody to speak out.

The way communication is structured follows the hierarchy of powers
allready established in babylon's mediascapes and, worst than ever,
money is the main requirement to spread a voice and let it be heard by
others.

</para>

<para>

Neverthless, proprietary software spreads the dependence from business
companies thru the populace: whenever we share our knowledge on how to
use a certain software, we make the people in need to buy the tools
from merchants in order to express their creativity. This is great
responsability for anyone of us who teaches somebody how to do
something with software: the need to buy will be slavery under the
merchantile interests of capitalism.

</para>

<para>

The roots of Rasta culture can be found in Resistance to slavery.
This software is not a business.  This software is free as of speech
and is one step in the struggle for Redemption and Freedom.  This
software is dedicated to the memory of Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey,
Marthin Luther King, Steve Biko, Walter Rodney, Malcom X; in
solidarity with Mumia Abu Jamal and all those who still resist to
slavery, racism and oppression, who still fight imperialism and seek
an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism in our World.

  </para>

And Much Blessings in Jah Luv to All Those who still Resist.

<title>Streamtime</title>
<subtitle>Employing dyne:bolic for the freedom of communication</subtitle>

<indexterm><primary>streamtime</primary></indexterm>

<para>

<ulink url="http://www.streamtime.org">Streamtime</ulink> is a project
of <emphasis>Radio Reedflute</emphasis> in collaboration with
<emphasis>Rastasoft</emphasis>, developed with artists and activists
from Iraq and elsewhere. Streamtime is a loose network of media
activists dedicated to assist autonomous networking. Streamtime uses
old and new media for the production of content and networks in the
fields of media, arts, culture and activism in crisis areas, like
Iraq.

</para>


<para>

We imagine improvised expressive devices like a CD that turns your PC
into an on line streaming studio. Imagine a mob that creates a traffic
jam. Think of the religious policeman in London, the konfused kollege
kid and the jealous dentist in Baghdad and the jailed blogger blogging
on in Cairo. Building autonomous networks in extreme conditions.

</para>

<para>

Streamtime uses old and new media for the production of content and
networks in the fields of media, arts, culture and activism in crisis
areas, like Iraq. Streamtime offers a diffuse environment for
developing do-it-yourself media. We focus on a cultural sense of
finding your own way in the quagmire that is Iraq, and its
representation in the global media. We should not try to change
politics in order to foster cultural change; we should support
cultural manifestation in order to force political change.

</para>

<para>

Streamtime may take the form of a campaign, a work of collaborative
art, a current of unheard sounds, unspeakable words and unseen
imaginations.
</para>

<para>
Remote interaction and ubiquitous dialogues, dematerialized
communication and participation on the streets.  Space in its
territorial, acoustic and cybernetic dimensions is fragmented and
recomposed realtime.  Hacking codes both moral and digital, forming
new maps, mutant drawings and unstable skins.  Information overload
can be abandoned in favor of consciousness and collaborative
practices.  Memory has a digital, diverse, horizontal voice.
