Email is nowadays the most widespread technology used for personal
communication on the net. Alltough it is often not secured for privacy

If you are concerned about privacy then you probably allready heard
about the solution to secure email communication:

</para>

<para>
Encryption is a technique based on mathematical formulas, it can ensure
security in your communication by using two keys: a private and a public
one, you will give the public to your friends while keep the private one to
decypher the messages you receive - everyone wanting to send you a secure
message will need to use your public key to encrypt it and only your private
key will be able to decrypt it.
