<subtitle>audio software included in dyne:bolic</subtitle>

<para>
This distribution is full with audio software to do all kind of things:
electronic music, sound processing, voice effects, interviews and more.
And there is one important thing that makes this system superior to any
other commercial solution: there is no competition :)
</para>

<para>
Most of the audio applications in dyne:bolic can be connected together,
input to output, in order to form a chain of tools processing the sound:
this is done thanks to a technologies like JACK and the Advanced Linux
Sound Architecture. Instead of keeping separated the tasks of every
single application, now it is possible to take advantage of the great
variety of approaches that a GNU/Linux system like dyne:bolic has to
offer.
</para>

<para>
This revolutionary approach will surely pay you back the effort to
be introduced to its use, a good starting point is the Spot perspective
