<title>Surf the web</title>
<subtitle>software to access the world wide web</subtitle>

<para>
There are three different ways to access the WWW pages on the net using
dyne:bolic, thanks to the variety of web browsers developed for the
GNU/Linux platform.
</para>

<para>
The first and most familiar browser is <emphasis>Firefox</emphasis> which
is developed by the Mozilla team in order to have a fully capable tool to
access the web. Firefox offers an intuitive interface, bookmark handling
and a couple of plugins that can be used to extend its functionalities.
</para>

<para>
Then we have <emphasis>Links</emphasis> which is a lightweight alternative
to the previous: it runs much faster on old computers while still offering
most of the crucial functionalities. It is remarkable its quality and speed
in rendering web pages, making it a great tool for presentations.
</para>

<para>
At last there is <emphasis>Lynx</emphasis> which is a text-only browser
capable to show the text on a web page without images, which can result
in a faster access to the content, while being the faster tool available
to browse the web.
</para>

<para>
Besides the browsers, dyne:bolic also includes a powerful "spider" to
crawl and download entire websites: <emphasis>WGet</emphasis>, which is
a commandline tool. As usual you can discover how it works by consulting
the manual from an XTERM, typing <emphasis>man wget</emphasis>.
</para>

<title>Email and encryption</title>
<subtitle>Send your letters in a safe way</subtitle>

<para>
Email is nowadays the most widespread technology used for personal
communication on the net. Alltough it is often not secured for privacy
and it is being easily intercepted by all kind of third parties:
to enforce governmental control, market surveys and spionage.
If you are concerned about privacy then you probably allready heard
about the solution to secure email communication:
<emphasis>encryption</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Encryption is a technique based on mathematical formulas, it can ensure
security in your communication by using two keys: a private and a public
one, you will give the public to your friends while keep the private one to
decypher the messages you receive - everyone wanting to send you a secure
message will need to use your public key to encrypt it and only your private
key will be able to decrypt it.
For more information on its usage and implementation refer to the web pages
on <ulink url="http://www.gnupg.org"></ulink>
</para>

<para>
Dyne:bolic comes equipped with an easy to use email program called
<emphasis>Sylpheed</emphasis> which can handle local downloading of mailbox,
filters, folders and multiple accounts, while being integrated with the
<emphasis>GnuPG encryption</emphasis> system.
</para>

<para>
Also included is <emphasis>GPA</emphasis> the GNU Privacy Assistant which
will help you in the task of generating your encryption keys and handling
the collection of your friends keys into a local keyring.
</para>

<para>
If you are interested into the history of encryption - an hot topic
which made USA react with their weapon export regulations to the spreading
of such techniques - I suggest you refer to the book "Crypto" by Stephen Levy.
