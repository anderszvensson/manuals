<title>dyne:bolic the hacktive media</title>

<para>
dyne:bolic GNU/Linux is a live bootable distribution working directly
from the CD without the need to install or change anything on
harddisk. It can recognize most of your hardware devices and offers a
vast range of softwares for sound and video production, streaming, 3d
modeling, peer to peer and filesharing, deejaying and veejaying,
games, a world navigator with detailed maps and factbooks and much
more ;)
</para>

<para>
Surf, stream, record, edit, encode and broadcast both sound and video,
all just in one CD you have simply to boot.
</para>

<para>
dyne:bolic it is made by and shaped on the needs of media activists,
artists and creatives to stimulate the production and not only the
fruition of digital and analog informations.
It takes birth as a grassroot effort to spread free software and
the spirit of sharing informations.
</para>

<para>
This manual will go thru all the tasks and possibilities offered by
dyne:bolic, listing the distributed applications and their functions.
</para>

<para>
You can get in contact with the community of users and developers thru
the discussion mailinglist <email>dynebolic@dyne.org</email> which you
can subscribe easily from the homepage <ulink

<title>How to use this manual</title>

<para>
In this manual I will give you an overview of the possibilities offered
by the dyne:bolic operating system, introducing you to the various
software included and their functionalities.
Far from being complete in exploring the possibilities of each
single software, you'll get introduced and find basic directions for
every specific task.
</para>

<para>
When in need of more information, expecially on how to operate a particular
software, you should consult the included <emphasis>man pages</emphasis>

<footnote>
<para>
The manpage is the name of the manual page describing usage of the
program, you can use it with the <emphasis>man</emphasis> command from
an <emphasis>XTERM</emphasis> inside dyne:bolic :
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>man hasciicam</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
it will show an higly informative text about the usage of the program;
the manpage name usually matches the name of the program executable
itself.
</para>
</footnote>


and the specific application's homepage.
Also consider to subscribe the user mailinglist of a specific software you
are using: there you can discover more about its development and realize if
any bugs that you encounter have been allready addressed by developers.
Always remember that the value of such communities is one of the strongest
resources of free software, as the Rastaman says:
One Love, One People, be United!
</para>

<title>This is Rasta software</title>
<para>
Jah Rastafari Livity bless our Freedom!
This is free software, you should share it for the good of yourself
and your people, respect others and let them express, be free and let
others be free.
Live long and prosper in Peace!
</para>

<para>
But remember there is no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance ina babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of applications for the production and not only
the fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio and has nothing
to envy to other proprietary systems, because freedom and share of knowledge
are solid principles for evolution and that's where this software comes from.
</para>

<para>
In the panorama of existing operating systems we see that there is a great
number of possibilities to listen: all kinds of "free to download" players
for audio and video, but no easy way for everybody to speak out loud and
spread their words.
The way communication is structured follows the hierarchy of powers allready
established in babylon's mediascapes and, worst than ever, money is the main 
requirement for making a voice spread and possible to be heard by others.
</para>

<para>
Neverthless, proprietary software spreads the dependence from business
companies thru the populace: whenever we share our knowledge on how to use
a certain software, we make the people in need to buy the tools from merchants
in order to express their creativity. This is great responsability for anyone
of us who teaches somebody how to do something with software: the need to buy
will be slavery under the merchantile interests of capitalism.
</para>

<para>
The roots of Rasta culture can be found in Resistance to slavery.
This software is not a business.
This software is free as of speech and is one step in the struggle for
Redemption and Freedom.
This software is dedicated to the memory of Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey,
Marthin Luther King, Steve Biko, Walter Rodney, Malcom X; with respect to
Mumia Abu Jamal and all those who still resist to slavery, racism and oppression,
who still fight imperialism and seek an alternative to the egemony of capitalism 
in our World.
</para>

<para>
Hic Sunt Leones.
And Much Blessings in Jah Luv to All Those who still Resist.
Selah.

You should read on this chapter if you are interested to know how this
operating system had birth and who contributed to make it real. Here i
introduce myself, i'm writing this manual and i'm the mantainer of
dyne:bolic, while i'm also the author of three software contained in
it: FreeJ, HasciiCam and MuSE.  My name is Denis "jaromil" Rojo, i'm a
south italian emigrant and <ulink
url="http://rastasoft.org">Rastaman</ulink> traveling ina babylon,
i code in C/C++ since more than 10 years and have a decent experience of
multimedia development under GNU/Linux.
</para>

<para>
My motivation in doing free software comes from the intention to give
people free access to comunication channels and to promote free
speech, against any form of censorship, adding my little effort to
break cultural and economical monopolies on information and
technology.
</para>

<para>
You are kindly invited to support my activity: you can offer me ospitality,

</para>

<para>
Enough about me, now i'd like to mention the great support and help
given by <ulink url="http://www.autistici.org/loa/bomboclat">Federico
"Bomboclat" Prando</ulink> and <ulink
url="http://www.autistici.org/loa/c1cc10">Francesco "C1cc10"
Rana</ulink> for the development of dyne:bolic. Together with Liw they
are the authors of <ulink
url="http://autistici.org/bolic1">bolic1</ulink> which is the first 
bootable GNU/Linux distribution i ever saw, reduced to fit just in a small
cardsized CD and aiming to give slick tools to analyze and tweak
networks. The <ulink
url="http://www.hackmeeting.org">hackmeeting</ulink> is the place
where we met, it is also where they presented bolic1 spawning in me
and Lobo the idea of dyne:bolic.
</para>

<para>
Bomboclat and C1cc10 helped me to compile and configure dyne:bolic,
giving suggestions and testing it on hardware. Most important thing
has been the great friendship between us which made it very funny to
meet and hack together on a common project.
</para>

<para>
Here i salute and give great respect also to <ulink
url="http://sfrajone.org">Alexander "Smilzo" Gnoli</ulink> who
hacked dyne:bolic to make it run on XBOX game
consoles, with the help of the documentation produced by the
<ulink url="http://xbox-linux.sf.net">xbox-linux</ulink> project.
We spend some time hacking together and sharing visions about dyne:bolic,
while he is planning to keep his focus on support for game consoles.

</para>

<para>
The following people also directly contributed to development: Lobo
(karma and knowledge), Sandolo and Rageman (scripts and tricks),
Nightolo and Rubik (MuSE interface coders), Maox (logo and graphics),
Eni and Newmark (watching horizons). I'm very sorry i can't say more
about them, alltough it would be worth, i know them fairly well and
they are all great hackers - probably i'll write more story here in
some future.
</para>

<para>
Help with online documentation was given by: Isazi, Quique,
Ali Uelke, Thomas Hassan, Ricardo Perry, Marco Herrn,
