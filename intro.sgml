<title>This is Rasta software</title>
 <para> Jah Rastafari Livity
bless our Freedom!  This is free software, share it for the good of
yourself and your people, respect others and let them express, be free
and let others be free.  Live long and prosper in Peace!
</para>

<para>
But, no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance inna babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of applications for production and not only
fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio, you don't need to buy
anything to express your voice.
Freedom and sharing of knowledge are solid principles for evolution and that's
where this software comes from.
</para>

<para>
Inna babylon, money is the main requirement to make a voice possible to
be heard by others. Capitalist and fundamentalist governments all around
the world rule with huge TV monopolies spreading their propaganda,
silencing all criticism.
</para>

<para>

This is a struggle for Redemption from existing operating systems
which always require new expensive hardware for doing the same as
ever: give us free players but make us pay for producing our own
voices. And the one who protects you rips you off, as the Arabs say.

</para>

<para>
Dyne:bolic is a tool to produce and publish yourself, freely.
There is nothing to consume here, there is all you need to create.
</para>

<para>

Commercial operating systems always give a possibility to listen - all
kinds of "free to download" players, but always with restrictions and
no easy way for everybody to speak out.

The way communication is structured follows the hierarchy of powers
allready established in babylon's mediascapes and, worst than ever,
money is the main requirement to spread a voice and let it be heard by
others.

</para>

<para>

Neverthless, proprietary software spreads the dependence from business
companies thru the populace: whenever we share our knowledge on how to
use a certain software, we make the people in need to buy the tools
from merchants in order to express their creativity. This is great
responsability for anyone of us who teaches somebody how to do
something with software: the need to buy will be slavery under the
merchantile interests of capitalism.

</para>

<para>

The roots of Rasta culture can be found in Resistance to slavery.
This software is not a business.  This software is free as of speech
and is one step in the struggle for Redemption and Freedom.  This
software is dedicated to the memory of Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey,
Marthin Luther King, Steve Biko, Walter Rodney, Malcom X; in
solidarity with Mumia Abu Jamal and all those who still resist to
slavery, racism and oppression, who still fight imperialism and seek
an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism in our World.

  </para>

<para>
Hic Sunt Leones.
And Much Blessings in Jah Luv to All Those who still Resist.
Selah.
