<para>
You  can  use FreeJ  in  your python  code  to  playback videos  quite
efficiently, it's API has been designed in C++ and the namespace tends
to be clear and intuitive. Layer lists map nicely to python arrays and
can be indexed almost natively,  for instance. Altough this feature it
at  its early  development stage  and  being refined  (with your  help
please!)   it can  already give  some good  satisfaction when  used in
conjunction with frameworks as PyGame and Crystal Space.

<para>
First make  sure you have installed  a version of  FreeJ compiled with
python bindings:  that means a  package or fresh source  compiled with
Swig and Python development packages (see the chapter Install, Compile
from source).   FreeJ should have  installed freej.py in  /usr/lib (or
/usr/local/lib  depending   from  your  installation   prefix)  inside
python/site-packages.
