<para>
You  can  use FreeJ  in  your python  code  to  playback videos  quite
efficiently: it's API has been designed in C++ and the namespace tends
to be clear and intuitive.  Using Python bindings for the FreeJ engine
can give good  results, also when used in  conjunction with frameworks
as PyGame and Crystal Space.

<para>
To get started, first make sure  you have installed a version of FreeJ
compiled    with    python   bindings:    that    means   a    package
like  <emphasis>python-freej</emphasis>  in   Debian  or  Ubuntu  (see
the <emphasis>Install</emphasis>  section of this manual),  or a fresh
source  compiled with  Swig  and Python  development packages.   FreeJ
should  have   installed  freej.py  in   /usr/lib  (or  /usr/local/lib
depending from your installation prefix) inside python/site-packages.
