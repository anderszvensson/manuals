<para>
FreeJ is a vision mixer: an instrument for realtime video manipulation
used in the fields  of dance teather, veejaying, medical visualisation
and TV.
</para>

<para>
With FreeJ multiple layers can be filtered thru effect chains and then
mixed together.  The supported layer  inputs are images,  movies, live
cameras,  particle  generators,  text  scrollers and  more.   All  the
resulting  video mix  can be  shown  on multiple  and remote  screens,
encoded into a movie and streamed live to the internet.
</para>

<para>
FreeJ can be controlled locally or remotely, also from multiple places
at the same time, using  its slick console interface; can be automated
via javascript  and operated via MIDI and  Joystick.

 Internally, FreeJ
handles video data in RGBA  colorspace, that is: 32bit wide collection
of 4 channels, 8bit each,  representing the red, green, blue and alpha
components.

<title>This is Free software</title>

<para>
Nobody should be  restricted by the software they  use. There are four
freedoms that every user should have:
</para>

<simplelist>
  <member>the freedom to use the software for any purpose,</member>
  <member>the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,</member>
  <member>the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and</member>
  <member>the freedom to share the changes you make.</member>
</simplelist>

<para>
When a program offers users all of these freedoms, we call it free software.
</para>

<para>
Developers who  write software can release  it under the  terms of the
GNU  GPL.  When they  do,  it  will be  free  software  and stay  free
software, no  matter who changes  or distributes the program.  We call
this copyleft: the software is copyrighted, but instead of using those
rights to restrict  users like proprietary software does,  we use them
to ensure that every user has freedom.

<title>This is Rasta software</title>

 <para> Jah Rastafari Livity
bless our Freedom!  This is free software, share it for the good of
yourself and your people, respect others and let them express, be free
and let others be free.  Live long and prosper in Peace!
</para>

<para>
But, no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance inna babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of applications for production and not only
fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio, you don't need to buy
anything to express your voice.
Freedom and sharing of knowledge are solid principles for evolution and that's
where this software comes from.
</para>

<para>
Inna babylon, money is the main requirement to make a voice possible to
be heard by others. Capitalist and fundamentalist governments all around
the world rule with huge TV monopolies spreading their propaganda,
silencing all criticism.
</para>

<para>

This is a struggle for Redemption from existing operating systems
which always require new expensive hardware for doing the same as
ever: give us free players but make us pay for producing our own
voices. And the one who protects you rips you off, as the Arabs say.

</para>

<para>
FreeJ is  a tool  to produce and  publish yourself, freely.   There is
nothing to consume here, there is all you need to create.
</para>

<para>

Commercial operating systems always give a possibility to listen - all
kinds of "free to download" players, but always with restrictions and
no easy way for everybody to speak out.

The way communication is structured follows the hierarchy of powers
allready established in babylon's mediascapes and, worst than ever,
money is the main requirement to spread a voice and let it be heard by
others.

</para>

<para>

Neverthless, proprietary software spreads the dependence from business
companies thru the populace: whenever we share our knowledge on how to
use a  certain software, we make the  people in need to  buy the tools
from merchants  in order  to express their  creativity. This  is great
responsability  for  anyone of  us  who  teaches  somebody how  to  do
something with  software: the  need to buy  will be slavery  under the
merchantile interests of capitalism.

</para>

<para>

The  roots of Rasta  culture can  be found  in Resistance  to slavery.
This software is  not a business.  This software is  free as of speech
and  is one step  in the  struggle for  Redemption and  Freedom.  This
software is dedicated to the memory of Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey,
Marthin  Luther  King,  Steve   Biko,  Walter  Rodney,  Malcom  X;  in
solidarity  with Mumia Abu  Jamal and  all those  who still  resist to
slavery, racism  and oppression, who still fight  imperialism and seek
an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism in our World.

  </para>

<para>
<ulink url="http://rastasoft.org">Hic Sunt Leones</ulink>.
And Much Blessings in Jah Luv to All Those who still Resist.
Selah.
