bless our Freedom!  This is free software, share it for the good of
yourself and your people, respect others and let them express, be free
and let others be free.  Live long and prosper in Peace!</P
><P
>But, no Peace without Justice.
This software is about Resistance inna babylon world which tries to control
more and more the way we communicate and we share informations and knowledge.
This software is for all those who cannot afford to have the latest expensive
hardware to speak out their words of consciousness and good will.
This software has a full range of applications for production and not only
fruition of information, it's a full multimedia studio, you don't need to buy
anything to express your voice.
Freedom and sharing of knowledge are solid principles for evolution and that's
where this software comes from.</P
><P
>Inna babylon, money is the main requirement to make a voice possible to
be heard by others. Capitalist and fundamentalist governments all around
the world rule with huge TV monopolies spreading their propaganda,
silencing all criticism.</P
><P
>&#13;This is a struggle for Redemption from existing operating systems
which always require new expensive hardware for doing the same as
ever: give us free players but make us pay for producing our own
voices. And the one who protects you rips you off, as the Arabs say.&#13;</P
><P
>Dyne:bolic is a tool to produce and publish yourself, freely.
There is nothing to consume here, there is all you need to create.</P
><P
>&#13;Commercial operating systems always give a possibility to listen - all
kinds of "free to download" players, but always with restrictions and
no easy way for everybody to speak out.

The way communication is structured follows the hierarchy of powers
allready established in babylon's mediascapes and, worst than ever,
money is the main requirement to spread a voice and let it be heard by
others.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Neverthless, proprietary software spreads the dependence from business
companies thru the populace: whenever we share our knowledge on how to
use a certain software, we make the people in need to buy the tools
from merchants in order to express their creativity. This is great
responsability for anyone of us who teaches somebody how to do
something with software: the need to buy will be slavery under the
merchantile interests of capitalism.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;The roots of Rasta culture can be found in Resistance to slavery.
This software is not a business.  This software is free as of speech
and is one step in the struggle for Redemption and Freedom.  This
software is dedicated to the memory of Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey,
Marthin Luther King, Steve Biko, Walter Rodney, Malcom X; in
solidarity with Mumia Abu Jamal and all those who still resist to
slavery, racism and oppression, who still fight imperialism and seek
an alternative to the hegemony of capitalism in our World.

activists dedicated to assist autonomous networking. Streamtime uses
old and new media for the production of content and networks in the
fields of media, arts, culture and activism in crisis areas, like
Iraq.&#13;</P

>&#13;We imagine improvised expressive devices like a CD that turns your PC
into an on line streaming studio. Imagine a mob that creates a traffic
jam. Think of the religious policeman in London, the konfused kollege
kid and the jealous dentist in Baghdad and the jailed blogger blogging
on in Cairo. Building autonomous networks in extreme conditions.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Streamtime uses old and new media for the production of content and
networks in the fields of media, arts, culture and activism in crisis
areas, like Iraq. Streamtime offers a diffuse environment for
developing do-it-yourself media. We focus on a cultural sense of
finding your own way in the quagmire that is Iraq, and its
representation in the global media. We should not try to change
politics in order to foster cultural change; we should support
cultural manifestation in order to force political change.&#13;</P

>&#13;Streamtime may take the form of a campaign, a work of collaborative
art, a current of unheard sounds, unspeakable words and unseen
imaginations.</P

>Remote interaction and ubiquitous dialogues, dematerialized
communication and participation on the streets.  Space in its
territorial, acoustic and cybernetic dimensions is fragmented and
recomposed realtime.  Hacking codes both moral and digital, forming
new maps, mutant drawings and unstable skins.  Information overload
can be abandoned in favor of consciousness and collaborative
practices.  Memory has a digital, diverse, horizontal voice.&#13;</P

>We urge you to reflect on the importance of keeping privacy for
personal data. Our present world is full of prevarication and
political imprisonments, war rages in several places and media is
mainly used for propaganda by the powers in charge. Some of us face
the dangers of being tracked by oppressors opposing our self
definition, independent thinking and resistance to omologation.</P

>People have the right to protect their privacy as much as their
freedom to express.</P
><P
>It is important to keep in mind that noone else than *you* can ensure
the privacy of your personal data. Server hosted services and web
integrated technologies gather all data into huge information pools
that are made available to established economical and cultural
regimes.</P
><P
>Since version 2.4 in this free operating system was introduced support
for strong encryption of your /home private data with Linux dm-crypt
i586 optimized Rijndael hashed SHA256, to provide an efficient and
user-friendly tool to protect your bookmarks, addressbook, documents
and emails by carrying them back with you, protected with a fairly
strong cryptographic algorithm.  </P
><P
>A passkey to read your data is stored inside a file, which is also
protected by a password. It is possible to keep everything with you on
a small usb stick, still being sure that the data won't be easily
recovered in case you loose it.  You can also give the passkey
protecting your data to a friend, to make the data unaccessible until
you meet again, which can be useful in case of tricky transports.
You'll find more informations in the following sections about nesting

which can be left untouched while the system is used. Still, depending
from your preferred way to operate, it can boot from harddisk, CD, USB
or network (explained the following chapter) and it can store data in
a single file that can be transported across different media.  The
whole operating system fits on a single CD, to run it from harddisk
you just need to copy the DYNE directory in it (see docking), while in
a diskless thin-client setup that can also be mounted via network.
This makes dyne:bolic very easy to be employed and mantained, while
there is no risk for misconfiguration: the system comes as it is,
providing a slick desktop full of applications ready to use.  </P

for it at every startup and if it is present starts using it
automatically.  </P

>The <SPAN

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>nesting</I
></SPAN

all the modifications you make to the system while using it (settings,
saved files, accounts, language, private data etc.) and transport or
backup them.  For example, in case you nest on your USB stick, you can
boot with it connected at startup, then that nest will be used and all
your /home and settings will always stay with you, in your personal
USB stick. This way you don't even need a laptop to travel around with
your software environment and data, just carry a dyne:bolic CD and
your nested USB stick with you, wherever you'll be able to boot it
you'll have your /home. </P

Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS), and NTFS (supported since version

>&#13;Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation :) you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Docking consists of copying the dyne/ directory from the CD to the
harddisk.  You don't need to change anything in your partition, just
copy a directory into it: drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the
icon of your harddisk, that's it!  It will occupy less than 700
megabytes of space.

After 'docking', you can boot with the CD inside and it will eject
automatically after the first phase of the boot process, this is the
sign the dock went well!  Like that, even without the need for
repartitioning or configuring a double boot, you can just switch to
dyne:bolic using a CD or a floppy, but still run it from harddisk at
full speed, like an installed operating system - and even better! ;)&#13;</P

><P
>&#13;With docking we saw that simply moving a directory in the root of a partition
can let us boot from CD and run from harddisk. This is a very simple and safe
way to have a dual-boot system: Cd in for dyne:bolic, CD out for anything else.
Still some people really likes to get rid of the CD, so here it is explained how.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Keep in mind that <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>the following operation is not necessary to run dyne:bolic from harddisk</I

If you are not familiar with boot sectors and partition geometry you might need the
intervention of an expert when anything goes wrong. Furthermore, in case of a mistake you
might delete all the data stored on your harddisks and/or be left without the possibility
to boot back into your old operating system.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;In order to boot from harddisk you need a bootloader (Lilo or Grub) installed.
We recommend the use of Grub for its simplicity and flexibility: in fact that
is the default bootloader dyne:bolic will install for you, but in case you have
Lilo already installed and you don't want to change it, then there is also a way
to add a dyne:bolic entry to it.&#13;</P

you are prompted, at the end of the process you will be able to boot your computer

><P
>&#13;<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>To re-configure your bootloader</I
></SPAN
> (not necessary if
you installed one from scratch using dyne:bolic) go look into your harddisk
partitions, in case you have a directory boot/ see if inside there is another
directory called grub/, if yes there you found your grub configuration, a simple text file
called grub.conf or menu.lst which you have to edit by hand, adding a
few lines at the bottom in order to add dyne:bolic among the boot menu
selection:

<PRE

initrd /dyne/initrd.gz</KBD
></PRE

After doing that you'll need to set the harddisk where you have
docked: where it says "ADJUST THiS" change the
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>(hd0,0)</I
></SPAN
> if necessary: hd0,1 for hda2 - hd0,2 for
hda3 - hd1,0 for hdb1 and so on... trying wrong values is not
dangerous and in case you are confused there is a lot more
documentation about this process in the grub manual pages.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;In case you have installed lilo, search among your harddisk partitions
for the directory etc/ and then inside for the lilo.conf file, if
found then add the following lines at the end of it:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>&#13;image = /dyne/2618ck1d.krn

you boot, which in lilo is configured by the
<SPAN

usually at the beginning of the lilo.conf file.

Please note the "image =" parameter takes a full path to
the kernel file, which is named after it's version in a condensed form,
for instance here 2618ck1d stands for 2.6.18-ck1-dyne .
The condensed format is necessary for a 8.3 filename restriction of
the isolinux CD boot system.</P

different devices: <SPAN

1KB blocks on the device. If you know how big your USB stick is, you
can find it this way. ~1,000,000 blocks = a 1 gigabyte device; ~64,000

device is <SPAN

it as necessary.</P
><P

we are using the console based cfdisk here, but you can also try to
use Parted which is a graphical tool in MENU-&#62;FILES-&#62;Parted.  Be
careful that you selected the right device to operate on (eventually

case you want to use EXT3 instead of EXT2. However, it is probably not
advised to use the EXT3 journaled filesystem on a flash/USB device:
journaling writes to the disk more often than necessary, which wears
out the USB device more quickly. Use a non-journaled filesystem such
as EXT2 (Linux only) or FAT32 (if you want to make your usb device
readable outside of Linux). The default (ext2) is a safe choice,
however, you may want to read up on journaled vs non-journaled file
systems and make an informed decision in your case.</P

>Dyne:bolic is developed with your privacy in mind: as mentioned before
the NEST can be encrypted to make your private data unaccessible
unless your password is provided, now we'll proceed to analize in deep
all the aspects of this security measure.</P
><P
>When an encrypted nest is created, every file you place in your home
directory will be preserved in a scrambled form using a
Rijndael/SHA256 algorithm: such a cypher can be considered very
secure, maybe some military organizations are able to break it, but
anyway that would be very expensive in terms of resources employed.</P
><P
>Dyne:bolic encryption mechanism employes a passfile "dyne.nst.gpg"
which contains the cypher used to protect your data: that file holds
the password that, matched together with your dyne.nst file, can
access all the data you store in your nest. So actually that file is
very precious for your privacy, you should be careful and not copy it
around.</P
><P
>Since the passfile is so delicate, it is also protected with a
password: the one you choose at the beginning, which is used to
scramble the passfile through a CAT5 algorithm. Keep in mind that this
cypher algorithm is weak and eventually, in case an intruder takes
possession of your .gpg passfile, it will be easy to crack.</P
><P
>Now in practical terms all this encryption scheme means that you can
safely move around your dyne.nst file separated from the dyne.nst.gpg
passfile: there will be no intrusion in the data stored inside even in
case you loose it. It also means that you can give your passfile to a
friend, still protected by the password you memorized, so that neither
you nor your friend will be able to access the nest until you meet up
again. More in general, this scheme lets you separate your encrypted
data from the passfile, still keeping everything sealed by the
password you keep in mind, and move the data around in different
places being sure meanwhile it's not accessed by anyone else.</P
><P
>So for sure we can say our privacy protection is way above the usual
schemes used in most common operating systems, which keep your data in
clear and physically accessible.
  </P
><P
>In case you are involved in some mission critical task and you are
facing the possibility of imprisonment and torture, you should take a
bit more care. A good practice would be to customize a bit the startup
scripts of dyne:bolic to have a false password prompt, the
/lib/dyne/nest.sh script is a good start.  Another way can be to have
an encrypted nest for which you would disclose the password if forced
to, but then also another encrypted file hidden somewhere that is not
prompting for a password at every boot.</P

smooth framerate, can record while streaming, efficiently uses
bandwidth when running on multicast and can stream audio synced with

Jaromil ever published (2000), distributed by dyne.org. It is capable
of rendering a video into text, having letters in place of colors,
filling up the image as a greyscale palette. With such an encoding the
images look way less detailed, but pretty cool, and the stream uses
very low bandwidth: Hasciicam can upload video via ftp to a server and
can be viewed directly from any web browser (also text based) - so it
can work to provide a video stream even using very old computers, and
adds a special bit to it: the ASCII chars. As drawbacks here we have
that the video is formed of characters: nifty, but doesn't gives a
clear picture, it is just monochrome and can't achieve a smooth

The first and most familiar browser is <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

is developed by the Mozilla team in order to have a fully capable tool to
access the web. Firefox offers an intuitive interface, bookmark handling

to the previous: it runs much faster on old computers while still offering
most of the crucial functionalities. It is remarkable its quality and speed
in rendering web pages, making it a great tool for presentations.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;

In order to edit webpages, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Nvu</I

web designers, which provides a powerful WYSIWYG environment that is
fully integrated with the Firefox/Mozilla standards of webpages. It is
a user-friendly tool that you'll find available also for many other
platforms and operating systems, so it's worth a little effort to
learn how to use it, then you can have your homepage ready in minutes.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;

A powerful "spider" is also included to crawl and download entire
websites: <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>WGet</I
></SPAN
>, which is a commandline tool. As
usual you can discover how it works by consulting its manual from an
XTerminal, typing <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>man wget</I
></SPAN
>.&#13;</P

run by default: <SPAN

key will be able to decrypt it.

this to list the contents of any directory you are in. Try typing this
command in a terminal window and see what you get. Now, one feature of
Linux commands is that you can add various parameters to them. This is
quite  a  simple  thing  to  do,  and refines  the  way  you  use  the
command. Usually these parameters are added to the command by typing a
'  - '  directly after  the command  and then  the parameter  names or
abbreviations. For example if I type the following:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"

the <SPAN

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>ls</I

'long list'  and refers to  a type of  format that the  ls information
should be displayed in.  This  format gives more information than just
typing the  ls command by  itself... Try the  two out and  compare the
difference.</P
><P
>You might  well ask 'how  do I know  what the parameters are  for each

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>cd</I
></SPAN

the  file-system on  your  computer.  cd  stands for  <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Change
Directory</I
></SPAN
>. Try it out by typing ls to get a list of all the
files  and folders in  the directory  you are  currently in.   Now try
typing ls followed  by the name of  one of the files in  the list, for
example if there was a file called 'me.txt' I could type:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd me.txt</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B

>

This will give an error! Why?  Because you can't change to a directory
if it is a file. It's good to try this so that you understand that you
can't  do any  damage by  making a  mistake with  cd. To  change  to a
directory you type cd followed by  the name of a directory you want to
navigate to.   If there  was a directory  called 'src' listed  when we
tried the ls command, we would type:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd src</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

If that was successful then the  terminal won't throw up an error. Try
it with  a real  directory on your  computer. If  you fail it  will be
because either you don't have  permissions to enter the directory, you
misspelled the directory name, or the directory simply doesn't exist.</P
><P
>Now, a word about the  Linux file-system. Generally, if the system has
been set up nicely for you, you will be working in your <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>home
directory</I
></SPAN
>.   This is  normally located  in a  set  place in
Linux. To find your home directory first type the following:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd /</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

This will place you in the top directory on your computer's file-system.</P
><P
>If you  now type  ls this will  show the  list of directories  on your
computer at the top-most level of the file structure.</P
><P
>There   are  some  important   directories  here,   the  <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>man
hier</I
></SPAN
> command  will give you an overview  and description of
their meaning;  but now  you need  to be most  concerned with  the one
named <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>home</I
></SPAN
>.  To change  to this directory  we can
use the cd command we learned earlier:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>cd home</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

Now if you type  ls you will be shown a list  of more directories, and
hopefully one that is the same  as your username.  This is your /home/
directory.     Now,    we     have    been    navigating    to    this
using <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>relative positioning</I
></SPAN
>, that is -- if I am in
the top directory  and I type 'cd  home' then I will be  placed in the
home directory  where all the  user's individual home  directories are
kept.</P
><P
>If I  was somewhere else on  the file system  and I typed 'cd  home' I
would get  an error.  If you  need to, you  can use <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I

paths</I
></SPAN
> to the  directory you wish to get  to.  As an example
if I  was in  some dark  corner of my  file-system and  I need  to get

<PRE

CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP

fit nicely into my little terminal window so it will go scrolling past
faster than  is useful. To slow  it down so  I can read the  output we

If I used this  in my 1000 file directory I get one  page at a time of
output and pressing  the space-bar shows the next  page.  Pressing 'q'
quits more. Ok, so you might be wondering what the funny straight line

>The above listing is a  fairly standard directory structure for Linux.
Each name on the far  right represents a directory, and each directory
contains   files   and  directories   that   are   specific  to   that
directory. the  'lib' directory,  for example contains  code libraries
that the  software on your  system uses. For  now you only need  to be
concerned with  one directory:  the 'home' directory.   This directory
contains folders  that have  names corresponding to  each user  of the
machine. If you  log in as 'adam' for example then  you will be logged
into a  directory in the 'home'  directory with the same  name as your
username (i.e., 'adam' in this example).</P
><P
>The important thing  to be aware of right now  is this Linux directory
structure. The other important thing is that Linux is mostly comprised
of text files, so  you can change almost every part of  Linux - how it
looks  and works  -  by just  editing  the appropriate  text file.  In
Windows and Macintosh environments you  would usually do these kind of
changes  through  small applications  with  a  graphic user  interface
(GUI). In Windows,  for example, if you want  to change the resolution
of your  display you  use the 'display'  control panel located  in the
'control panels' directory. In Linux you can do this by editing a text
file.</P
><P
>This  has some  advantages  - one  is that  it  gives you  a lot  more
control.  But it also has some  disadvantages - it can be difficult to
learn which files  to edit and what to change.  Sometimes, to ease the
transition to Linux from other  operating systems, you will find there
are configuration  softwares for Linux  installed on your  system that
use  a  GUI  (Graphical  User  Interface)  similar  to  Macintosh  and
Windows. This  is not always the  case however, and  so eventually you
will find yourself doing this manually with a text editor.</P

><P
>Now, I  am imagining vim is quite  a bit different to  any text editor
you have used before, so perhaps some explanation is needed. Vim opens
a file initially  as a read only file. This means  that when you first
open the file with vim you are not allowed to change the file. Vim has
then a  whole world of commands  you can use  to work on the  file and
most of the  commands are executed by just typing  a single letter, or
they are in the format:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>: command</PRE
>

Where  'command' is  the name  of  the command  you wish  to use.  The
commands are  all designated  by shortcuts. An  'i' , for  example, is
short  for 'insert'.  The following  is a  table of  vim  commands you
should know:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>command                                 action
i  (only used in read-only mode)        insert text
:w (only used in read-only mode)        write changes to file
u  (only used in read-only mode)        undo changes
:q (only used in read-only mode)        quit vim</PRE
>&#13;</P
><P
>In  addition, by pressing  the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>esc</I
></SPAN
>  (escape) key,
you will tell vim to return to the original mode (read only). You must
actually  press escape  before  you  execute any  of  the commands  in
vim. For example if I wanted  to open the file "README" and then alter
some    text,   I    would   do    the   following,    starting   with
typing <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>vim README</I
></SPAN
> in the terminal. This will open
the "README"  file as  explained above.   Then if I  wish to  edit the
file, I  use my arrow keys  to navigate to  where I want to  insert or
delete some text.  I  then press <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>i</I
></SPAN
>, this will put
me in  the insertion mode and now  anything I type will  appear in the
document itself.  When I have  finished making the changes I will then
press  the  <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>esc</I
></SPAN
>  key,  and finally  to  save  the
changes I press <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>:w</I
></SPAN
>. This will write the file with
the  new  changes.   I  then  need   to  quit  from  vim  so  I  press
the <SPAN

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

version of  Linux has its  own package management system.  However all
types of  Linux allow  the user to  install software using  the source
code.  However you  probably don't want to tackle  this process unless

about the  Linux file system. If  you don't know about  these two then

Where 'packagename'  in the example above  is the actual  name of your

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>tar.gz</I

> file and creates a new directory with all
the extracted sources.  Now you must change your working directory to
this new directory using the 'cd' command.  Usually the new directory
name is the name of the compressed source package minus the '.tar.gz'
suffix.  For example, if my package really was called
'packagename.tar.gz' then after running the 'tar zxvf' command on it I
would be left with a new directory called 'packagename' and then I
would type 'cd packagename' to enter this new directory.  If you are
not sure of the name of the newly created package type 'ls'.</P

already have installed, what kind of Linux you are running etc etc
etc.</P
><P
>The most common problem that will occur at this stage is that the
configure script will halt and tell you that software library that the
new software depends on is missing. This can be a pain which is why
people invented package management systems. However if you do
experience this error then you need to use a search engine to find out
what software the error message is talking about and where to get it,
then start the installation process again with this new package. I am
not kidding when I say that this can sometimes mean an installation
can take days while you search and download all the packages you need.</P

in the install process is make like so:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>make</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

This command actually makes (compiles) the software for you. You will
then end up with a whole lot of compiled files which in total makes up
your software. The 'make' process can take a while depending on the
speed of your machine and the size of the package sources you are
installing. Running other applications will also slow down the
process.</P
><P
>When *make* has stopped, type the following:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>make install</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

this will install the newly created software in the correct places in
your system. So now you just need to type the name of the application
in your terminal window and it should run. If it doesn't run and
throws an error, a common remedy is to type *ldconfig* and then try
again.  <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I

operating system knows there are new library files etc.</P

>&#13;Dyne:II comes with an SDK to re-master a dyne liveCD including all
your modifications and to package additional software collections.
In fact, Dyne:II is a Dyne to produce Dyne.

See it like a Nomad Distribution attached to no hardware. You carry
your live cd/dvd/usb key loaded. you boot on it on any machine, you do
your stuff (from a user AND/OR developer point of view), you create a
new live cd, you remove all your traces and you leave the camp.  Just
walk around the world with your rewritable CD or usb-stick and that's
it.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;Dyne:bolic is a quite simple and minimalistic operating system (the
underlying distribution philosophy can be referred to the Slackware
one and more in general to the KISS principle), all scripted in shell,
awk and sed from scratch. Function libraries along with auxiliary
programs are all included in the /lib/dyne directory, where the code
is fairly documented.&#13;</P
><P
>&#13;In this chapter you'll find documentation on how to create and publish
new modules, repack a new CD. For more informations and as a reference
to the inner structure of dyne:bolic keep in mind this distribution is
written from scratch following the
book <A
HREF="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Linux From

everything was put together</P
><P
>The GNU C and C++ Compiler is included along with several scripting
language and relative toolkit externals as Python, Perl, Tcl/Tk and
Ruby. Also 3 different integrated development environments are
included for visual programming: <SPAN

you'll be prompted with two questions: it is safe to
answer <SPAN

><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

></SPAN

change things in the dyne:II core:

<SAMP

in case you don't give an answer, it will default to NO after 10
seconds and go on.</P
><P
>This procedure will create an SDK directory inside $DYNE_SYS_MNT/dyne,
then populate it with development files that are downloaded from the
online subversion repository if you have network connectivity.</P
><P
>With the SDK you can pack modifications to your system inside a new CD
ISO: that is created out of the contents of SDK/cdrom, you can add and
remove modules from SDK/cdrom/dyne/modules as well add things inside
the CD filesystem.</P

><DIV
CLASS="SECTION"
><HR><H2
CLASS="SECTION"
><A
NAME="AEN1144"
>Create new software modules</A
></H2
><P
>Once you have an SDK and some space available on your harddisk
you can start creating your own software modules to add applications
to dyne:bolic, see the "Extra software modules" section of this manual
for more information about features and usage of .dyne modules, now
we'll go on with some instructions on how to create them.</P
><P
>First of all make sure you dock your system on a harddisk, then create
an SDK (see previous chapter). When you have an SDK directory in your
harddisk you can see it's location just typing:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>echo $DYNE_SYS_MNT/SDK</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

Next step is to create the module directory in the SDK, so let's
choose our module name first: we are going to create the spaghetti
module, with the commands

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>mkdir -p $DYNE_SYS_MNT/SDK/modules/spaghetti</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>mkdir $DYNE_SYS_MNT/SDK/modules/spaghetti/bin</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>mkdir $DYNE_SYS_MNT/SDK/modules/spaghetti/lib</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>touch $DYNE_SYS_MNT/SDK/modules/spaghetti/VERSION</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

basically we are just creating the bin and lib directories and a
VERSION file inside the module, you can do that with any filebrowser
or midnight commander if you like: c'mon, make yourself comfortable ;)</P
><P
>The last thing to do is to activate our spaghetti module, mounting it
on /opt/spaghetti since all modules are activated in the /opt
prefix. To do that we use again a DyneSdk command

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>dynesdk mount</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
>
<SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>source /boot/dynenv.modules</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

That's it! our new module is mounted in /opt and we have our PATHs
configured accordingly.</P
><P
>Keep in mind that you need to use dynesdk mount once after every boot,
before starting development on your module. You can as well open up
for development an already existing module (your good old gnocchi
module for instance) with the command:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>dynesdk devel gnocchi</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

You'll be then prompted with a question, if you want to decompress the
content of the module for development, with an indication about the
space that will be occupied by it on your harddisk.</P
><P
>Now you can compile the spaghetti software you like with

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~ # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>./configure --prefix=/opt/spaghetti</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

or editing the PREFIX in the Makefile in some cases - and don't forget
the sauce! :)</P
><P
>To make it easier, when software is built with the usual "./configure
&#38;&#38; make &#38;&#38; make install", you can use
the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>dynemodconf</I
></SPAN
> command (followed by the module
name) instead of calling ./configure directly: that will set the
prefix and more environment correctly, for example to compile
"aglio-0.5" with flag "--with-basilico" inside our spaghetti module:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~/aglio-0.5 # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>dynemodconf spaghetti --with-basilico</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

Once you are done with cook... ahem, compiling, then you can squash
everything into a compressed .dyne module with

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>[d:b] ~/aglio-0.5 # </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>dynesdk squash spaghetti</KBD
> <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>[Enter]</B
></PRE
>

and that's it! your new module will be found in
$DYNE_SYS_MNT/dyne/SDK/cdrom/dyne/modules/spaghetti.dyne and ready
to be included in the next CD ISO that you can pack with dynesdk
mkiso.</P
><P
></P
><P
>Before releasing your module into the public, is a good idea to fill
up some information about your creation so that people can contact you
and visit software homepages. That's what the VERSION file is for, and
it's format is very simple:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>name            Spaghetti
desc            spaghetti pizza mandolino e presidente scemo
version         1.0
url             http://tuttifrutti.org/spaghetti
packager        The Crazy Cook http://tuttifrutti.org/~crazycook</PRE
>

Just use your favorite text editor to fill in these fields, leave a
space or a tab between the field name and value and that's it.</P
><P
>&#13;</P
><P
>You can add entries and submenus for the user to start up your
software. To do so create an applist file inside your module's etc
directory, like for example /opt/spaghetti/etc/applist.

The applist file will list application binaries, descriptions and ways
to start them up thru flags. Here it follows a description of the
format, basically a | separated list:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
># format:
# name | description | command | flags | web url | author

# flags:
# runonce | multi = if there should be only one instance running, or not
# terminal        = if it should run in a terminal
# manual          = if it's a manual entry
# root | user     = if it must be run as root or as user

# submenus can start and end with
# Begin | MySubmenu
# End | MySubmenu</PRE
>

for example:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>Begin | SPAGHETTI

AglioeOlio | aglio olio e peperoncino | pasta --agliolio | | http://tuttifrutti.org | The Crazy Cook
Puttanesca | olive capperi e alici | pasta --puttan | | http://tuttifrutti.org | The Crazy Cook
Pesto | pesto alla genovese | pasta --pesto | | http://tuttifrutti.org | The Crazy Cook

End | SPAGHETTI</PRE
>

You can also have submenus, just use Begin and End once again
inside. For a complete example see the system application list in
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>$DYNE_SYS_MNT/applist</I
></SPAN
>.</P
><P
>In case your module needs to set environment variables (like custom
paths and general settings for applications) you can simply declare
them in a env file inside the etc directory. That file can contain
declarations of environment variables, one per line, which will be
exported in the running system, for example in our spaghetti module
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>/opt/spaghetti/etc/env</I
></SPAN
> will look like:

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>KITCHEN_PATH=/opt/spaghetti/lib/kitchen
GLOBAL_TASTE=spicy
COOK_PROFILE=big_nose</PRE
></P
><P
>You can include your own home settings inside a module, so that they
will override the default dyne:II user settings. This is useful when
you want to change the window manager default configuration (with a
new desktop image for example) or deliver pre-configured applications
(with a .config file in home).

To do this you simply have to create a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>skel</I
></SPAN
>
directory inside your module: all files that are included in it will
be automatically copied into all users home directories and setted up
to be adopted for users that are created in future.  &#60;</P
><P
></P
><P
>In your modules you can include any kernel module correctly compiled
for the dyne:II kernel.

To do this you have to create a <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>kernel</I
></SPAN
> directory
inside your module: all kernel modules contained will be searched and
loaded if found by the <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>loadmod</I
></SPAN
> command, to be
used instead of the standard modprobe.

In case the module is not naturally requested by your hardware
configuration (not listed by the pcimodules command), you build your
own detection or force loading of your module inside a module startup
script.

You can prepare a script inside your module to be executed every time
your module is activated.

To do this you have to create an <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>etc</I
></SPAN
> directory
inside your module: <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>all executable files included in the
rc.* wildcard</I
></SPAN
> will be launched at startup, with the first
$1 argument being the name of the module itself.</P
><P
>So here is resumed the file structure contained in modules:
<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>VERSION required file 	    contains information about the module and its sources
bin 	optional directory  contains all binaries, automatically included in $PATH
lib 	optional directory  contains all libraries, automatically included in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
etc 	optional directory, contains rc.* startup scripts executed at activation
skel 	optional directory, contains all settings to be added to /home/user and /etc/skel
kernel 	optional directory, contains kernel modules that can be loaded by loadmod</PRE

><P
>The  reason of  this setup  is  that, having  all the  kernel and  its
modules in two files easily recognizable by their extension it becomes
very easy  to swap kernels in a  dock: just drop the  new files inside
the dyne/ directory and re-configure the bootloader accordingly. Since
the .krn and .kmods files  are already compressed, distribution of new
dyne:bolic  kernels can  be done  as-is,  just sharing  the two  files

>You shouldn't use the .DOC format for many reasons: it exposes
all your previous changes in your documents which can often lead to
a privacy problem, it can vehicle dangerous viruses that affect other
proprietary systems and it stores your text in a non-readable way
which ties you up to the availability of proprietary software.
