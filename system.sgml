<title>Discover the dyne:bolic system</title>

<section>
<title>Your desktop environment</title>


<para>
Dyne:bolic doesn't requires to install anything on your harddisks,
which can be left untouched while the system is used; depending from
your preferred way to operate, it can boot from CD, USB or harddisk
and it can store data in a single file on a harddisk or USB stick.
The whole operating system fits on a single CD, to run it from harddisk
<!-- you just need to copy the dyne/ directory in it (see <xref linkend="dock-sect">), while in a diskless thin-client -->
you just need to copy the dyne/ directory in it (see docking), while in a diskless thin-client
setup that can also be mounted via network.
This makes dyne:bolic very easy to be employed and mantained, while there
is no risk for misconfiguration: the system comes as it is, 
providing a slick desktop full of applications ready to use.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>WindowMaker</primary></indexterm>

<para>
The desktop manager is
<ulink url="http://www.windowmaker.info">WindowMaker</ulink>,
it offers you multiple desktops (try alt+2 and other numbers)
and a menu that you can recall by clicking the right mouse button on
the background. On the upper right corner you have your storage devices
which you can access with a double click.
</para>

<para>
The menu of applications can be visualized with a right click of the
mouse on the desktop. Software is organized by tasks, so 
you can easily find your way to play, record, edit and stream both
audio and video, communicate and publish text, webpages, 3d animations
and much more.
</para>

<title>Access your data volumes</title>

<para>

You can easily access your files on connected storage devices (harddisks, cd, floppy,
usb) using the buttons in the upper right corner of your desktop, as
well your local network shares and remote internet accounts.  Your partitions
are automatically mounted in the <emphasis>/mnt</emphasis> directory, which you
see linked in your home as <emphasis>Volumes</emphasis>.
You can read and write on all your volumes except for NT filesystems, which you can only read.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>usb pendrive</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Usb storage devices (like usb pens, smartcards and some digital photo
cameras) can be opened simply with a double click on the usb symbol.
But beware that sometimes unusual partition schemes can confuse the autodetection,
so you can try by hand in a Xterminal issuing manual commands:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/usb</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

Where you must substitute X with letters (a,b,c...) and Y with numbers
(1,2,3) for example <emphasis>/dev/sda2</emphasis>.

</para>

<para>
If you have only one cdrom or dvd player on your computer
with <emphasis>docking</emphasis> you can have it free for
use after booting dyne:bolic (see following chapter about DOCKING),
then you can access, browse, play and rip compact discs and dvd.
</para>

<indexterm><primary>filesystem organization</primary></indexterm>

<para>
To have a general overview about the organization of various directories you find in GNU/Linux systems,
read the manual <emphasis>hier</emphasis> (type "man hier" in the Xterminal).

<section>
<title>Nest your home and settings</title>

<indexterm><primary>nesting</primary></indexterm>

<para>
By default your <emphasis>/home, /etc and /var</emphasis> directories reside
in RAM memory: every file and configuration you save will not be there again at the next boot.

To save your home and settings permanently you need to create a <emphasis>NEST</emphasis>:
it is just a file on the harddisk or on the usb storage device where they will be stored
and loaded back at every boot. You just need to create your nest once, dyne:bolic looks for
it at every startup and if its present starts using it automatically.
</para>


<para>
The <emphasis>nesting</emphasis> function is very practical to keep
all the modifications you make to the system while using it (settings,
saved files, accounts, language etc.) and transport or backup them.
For example, in case you nest on your USB stick, you can boot with it connected
at startup, then that nest will be used and all your /home and settings
will always stay with you, in your personal USB stick.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>How to create a nest?</emphasis> at the boot screen or in your <emphasis>Home</emphasis>, click on the
<emphasis>Configure</emphasis> button, then choose <emphasis>Nest</emphasis>
(the little icon of a duck). You will be prompted to create a nest
on your harddisk or USB stick, proceed choosing the partition you want
and how big you need it: good sizes may vary between 250 and 500 megabytes,
depending from how much you plan to use the system, modify it and open it
for other users.
</para>

<para>
Since version 2.0 of dyne:bolic you can also install new software inside
the nest! it will hold all modifications you apply to the original system,
overlaying them automatically using the Union filesystem.
</para>


<para>
In this way when you upgrade your system you simply have to get
a new dyne:bolic version, all your data is not affected by any
re-installation process and is safely stored in your nest, and
you don't risk to break your operating system with an upgrade.
</para>

<para>

If you nest on harddisk, the supported partition formats are: Dos,
Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS) and BSD (UFS), but not NTFS.  The
nest is just one file  created in the /dyne directory at the root of
your partition (C:\ or D:\ in the DOS filesystem) called
<emphasis>dyne.nst</emphasis>. To erase a nest simply delete that file.

</para>

<title>Install on harddisk? Dock!</title>
<indexterm><primary>docking</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation :) you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".

</para>

<para>

Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.

</para>

<para>

Docking consists of copying the dyne/ directory from the CD to the
harddisk.  You don't need to change anything in your partition, just
copy a directory into it: drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the
icon of your harddisk, that's it!  It will occupy less than 700
megabytes of space.

After 'docking', you can boot with the CD inside and it will eject
automatically after the first phase of the boot process, this is the
sign the dock went well!  Like that, even without the need for
repartitioning or configuring a double boot, you can just switch to
dyne:bolic using a CD or a floppy, but still run it from harddisk at
full speed, like an installed operating system - and even better! ;)

</para>

<para>

Of course when you want to remove the dock is easy: just delete the
/dyne directory in your harddisk!

</para>

<para>

Remember that docking is different from nesting:
<emphasis>Docking</emphasis> is done to run the system and all
application from harddisk instead of CD, <emphasis>nesting</emphasis>
is to store your home and settings in a single file on harddisk or usb
storage.

</para>

<para>

More online information about docking is available on the <ulink
url="http://lab.dyne.org/Docking">wiki community pages</ulink>.

<title>Extra software modules</title>

<indexterm><primary>modules</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Dyne:II offers the possibility to be expanded using software modules:
collections of applications that can be easily installed and used.  In
fact the basic system already contains some of these modules, that can
be found in your dock as the <emphasis>dyne/modules/</emphasis> directory.

</para>

<para>

Additional dyne modules are available online, to activate
them or include them in a CD you just drop the .dyne files into the
dyne/modules docked directory. Then reboot, that's it!

</para>

<para>

Users can easily keep their modules across different machines, always
finding back the software they need. Modules can also be used thru
different dyne versions: just update the core dock and then drop in
your good old modules.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>pure:dyne</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Download free and open source dyne modules online from <ulink
url="http://dynebolic.org"></ulink>, there are many interesting
extensions already: <ulink url="http://puredyne.goto10.org">pure:dyne</ulink> (Pure-Data and other digital art tools),
Open Office (all you need to handle office documents), Devel (more
development tools) and there will be the Games modules soon,
don't worry ;)

</para>

<indexterm><primary>developers documentation</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Developers wanting to create modules for certain software collections
can refer to documentation online at <ulink url="http://dev.dynebolic.org">dev.dynebolic.org</ulink>
which includes all necessary informations on how to do that.

</para>

<!--

<para>

When you install new modules, since it is so easy, the only care that
must be taken is their provenience, since a broken or malicious module
can access all your system. Of course to install a module you must be
root. On our website we'll suggest only modules we have tested, anyway
you're free to choose, it's all up to you to decide whom you trust,
you just did it by running this system on your computer didn't you?

</para>

<section> <title>Boot from harddisk</title>

<indexterm><primary>boot from harddisk</primary></indexterm>

<para>

With docking we saw that simply moving a directory in the root of a partition
can let us boot from CD and run from harddisk. This is a very simple and safe
way to have a dual-boot system: Cd in for dyne:bolic, CD out for anything else.
Still some people really likes to get rid of the CD, so here it is explained how.

</para>

<para>

Keep in mind that <emphasis>the following operation is not necessary to run dyne:bolic from harddisk</emphasis>.
If you are not familiar with boot sectors and partition geometry you might need the
intervention of an expert when anything goes wrong. Furthermore, in case of a mistake you
might delete all the data stored on your harddisks and/or be left without the possibility
to boot back into your old operating system.

</para>

<para>

In order to boot from harddisk you need a bootloader (Lilo or Grub) installed.
We recommend the use of Grub for its simplicity and flexibility: in fact that
is the default bootloader dyne:bolic will install for you, but in case you have
Lilo already installed and you don't want to change it, then there is also a way
to add a dyne:bolic entry to it.

</para>

<para>

The following instructions will cover various situations: you can omit some operations
in case your computer is already setted up with them.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>partitioning</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>cfdisk</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>mke3fs</primary></indexterm>

<para>

<emphasis>In case you are installing a computer from scratch</emphasis>, without
anything installed on it yet, then you need to partition the harddisk and format it.
You can do so using the command <emphasis>cfdisk</emphasis> to create or
modify your harddisk partitions, then <emphasis>mke3fs</emphasis> to format the partitions
(or other mk* commands in case you desire to use a different filesystem than Ext3).
<emphasis>Beware that this operation above will erase all the data on the disk</emphasis>.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>grub</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Once you have a disc partitioned and formatted you need to install the bootloader.
To do this use the command <emphasis>grubconfig</emphasis> and follow the steps
you are prompted, at the end of the process you will be able to boot your computer
directly into dyne:bolic, without the need to use a CD.

</para>


<para>

<emphasis>To re-configure your bootloader</emphasis> (not necessary if
you installed one from scratch using dyne:bolic) go look into your harddisk
partitions, in case you have a directory boot/ see if inside there is another
directory called grub/, if yes there you found your grub configuration, a simple text file
called grub.conf or menu.lst which you have to edit by hand, adding a
few lines at the bottom in order to add dyne:bolic among the boot menu
selection:

<screen>
<userinput>
title dyne:bolic RASTASOFT Afro Linux
root (hd0,0) # ADJUST THIS!
kernel /dyne/linux root=/dev/ram0 rw load_ramdisk=1 max_loop=64 vga=791
initrd /dyne/initrd.gz
</userinput>
</screen>

After doing that you'll need to set the harddisk where you have
docked: where it says "ADJUST THiS" change the
<emphasis>(hd0,0)</emphasis> if necessary: hd0,1 for hda2 - hd0,2 for
hda3 - hd1,0 for hdb1 and so on... trying wrong values is not
dangerous and in case you are confused there is a lot more
documentation about this process in the grub manual pages.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>lilo</primary></indexterm>

<para>

In case you have installed lilo, search among your harddisk partitions
for the directory etc/ and then inside for the lilo.conf file, if
found then add the following lines at the end of it:

<screen>
<userinput>

image = /dyne/linux
  root = /dev/ram0
  append = "max_loop=64"
  initrd = /dyne/initrd.gz
  label = dyne
  read-write
  vga = 791

</userinput>
</screen>

Being sure that the /dyne directory is inside the partition
you boot, which in lilo is configured by the
<emphasis>boot = /dev/hd*</emphasis>
usually at the beginning of the lilo.conf file.

</para>

<title>Cluster CPU farms</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic Linux kernel allows all the computers running the system on
the same local network to share CPU power by migrating processes from
machines that are working harder to machines that are idle. This
feature is provided to enhance multiprocessing computation on slower
computers: they are then aided by faster computers on the same
network, with a more equitous sharing of common resources.
</para>

<para>
The cluster activates itself at every boot and on every new
configuration of the network card, trying to autodetect other cluster
nodes on the network: the process of sharing CPU power is totally
automated and the groups are formed thru the autodiscovery scan of
each node.
</para>

<para>
Your Dyne:bolic system encloses all the clustering tools in the
filesystem directory <emphasis>/usr/mosix</emphasis>. You can manually
startup the clustering at any time by launching the command
<emphasis>/usr/mosix/openmosix start</emphasis> from an XTERM, while
in that directory you'll also find useful tools to control and gather
information on the way your network cluster works:
<emphasis>mosctl</emphasis> and <emphasis>showmap</emphasis> among the
others; for each you'll find also a man page.
</para>

<para>
This feature is implemented by a kernel patch from the OpenMosix
project, you can know more about this technology and discover about
advanced uses for it on the <ulink
url="http://openmosix.sf.net">OpenMosix webpage</ulink>, where you'll
find extensive documentation and usage guides, while there is also
a useful guide to the use of clustering in dyne:bolic on Spot's perspective
on Technology website <ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=12"></ulink>.

<title>For the curious hacker</title>

<para>
Now if you are wondering what's inside to make it work like it does,
you are very welcome to discover it, dynebolic is free software! and
hackers more familiar with GNU/Linux systems will easily recognize
the architecture.
</para>

<para>
But remember you are on your own in doing so, this documentation is
not about hacking and the author's objective for dynebolic was
to build an environment friendly for the end user, not necessarily
for those who want to modify it. Anyway, if you look for a
customizable bootable cd there are plenty to pick around, Morphix seems to be
a good one to start with.
</para>

<para>
A dyne:bolic SDK is available, it is the one used in development,
and there is a brilliant introduction on how to use it on Spot's site:
<ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=18"></ulink>.
</para>

<para>
You can visit the <ulink url="http://cvs.dyne.org">cvs.dyne.org</ulink>
which is where all dynebolic specific sourcecode is stored and thru all its
development revisions.
