<title>Discover the dyne:bolic system</title>

<section>
<title>Your desktop environment</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic is a preconfigured GNU/Linux system which runs without
installing anything on you harddisks, to run it doesn't need to make
any change to your stored data, in fact you can also boot it on
diskless computers. The whole operating system fits on a single CD.
It can also run from harddisk, without the need to change its
partition geometry: just store a local copy of one file big ~600MB.
This makes dyne:bolic very easy to be employed, while there
is no risk for misconfiguration: the system comes as it is, 
to provide you with a slick desktop full of applications ready to use.
</para>

<para>
The desktop is managed by
<ulink url="http://www.windowmaker.org">WindowMaker</ulink>,
it offers you multiple desktops (try alt+2 and other numbers)
and a menu that you can recall by clicking the right mouse button on
the background. On the upper right corner you have your storage devices
which you can access with a double click, on the lower right corner you
have a system monitor informing about your computer usage.
</para>

<para>
The menu of dyne:bolic is organized by tasks, in categories.
You can easily find software to play, record, edit and stream both
audio and video, communicate and publish text, webpages, 3d animations
and more. And of course you have also games ;)
</para>

<section>
<title>Access your data</title>

<para>
With dyne:bolic your <emphasis>/home</emphasis> directory resides
in your RAM memory
and every new file you write into it will not be there at the next
boot, unless you create a <emphasis>nest</emphasis>
<footnote><para>
see the following section about NESTING.
</para></footnote>
where to store your data and settings on harddisk or usb storage
devices.
</para>

<para>
You can easily browse your stored data (harddisks, cd, floppy, usb)
using the buttons in the upper right corner of your desktop.
Your harddisk partitions are automatically
mounted in the <emphasis>/vol</emphasis> directory and
you can both read and write

<footnote><para>
NTFS partitions are only readable, but non writable: use FAT32 instead!
</para></footnote>

the data inside them.

</para>

<para>
Usb storage devices (like usb pens, smartcards and digital photo
cameras) are generally supported
<footnote><para>
see <ulink url="http://www.linux-usb.org">www.linux-usb.org</ulink>
if your model is compatible with the Linux kernel.
</para></footnote>
: just double click the blue button with a usb symbol on it, the
connected device is automatically mounted in the removable media
directory <emphasis>/rem/usb</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
Data on floppy disks can be accessed as well using the floppy button,
the disk is automounted when you access the directory <emphasis>/rem/floppy</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
If you have an unused cdrom player on your computer (other than
the one booting dyne:bolic, or in case you docked the system

<footnote><para>
see the following section about DOCKING your system if you
want to run dyne:bolic from the harddisk, even without the need
for a CD player
</para></footnote>

then you can access, browse, play and rip a compact disc as well.
The cd is automatically mounted in
<emphasis>/rem/cd*</emphasis>
directories, where the star is a number starting from 1 in case you
have multiple readers.
If you have a cd burner, you can also use it to create cd and
you can even clone the dyne:bolic from the running system.
</para>

<para>
The <emphasis>Samba</emphasis> filesharing daemon is running on your
dyne:bolic: everything contained in the
<emphasis>/home/shared</emphasis> directory is accessible (read and
write) as a shared folder on the network you are connected, without
any password protection - the share is called 'dyne:bolic casbah'.
If you want to share other directories you'll need to tweak by hand
the configuration file in <emphasis>/etc/samba</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Finally, to have a general overview about the meaning and organizations
of the various directories you'll find in the system, you can open
an XTERM and type <emphasis>man hier</emphasis>.
And remember that the "man" command is your friend! any command is
documented and its manual can be recalled by typing
<emphasis>man command</emphasis> into a console terminal.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Nest your home and settings</title>

<para>
The <emphasis>nesting</emphasis> function offered by dyne:bolic is a quite
simple but revolutionary concept for the way operating systems usually
worked until now. dyne:bolic was the first (but no more the only)
GNU/Linux distribution really implementing it.
</para>

<para>
The concept is simple: you cannot modify the operating system, you
use it as it comes and you update it all in once with new versions,
it is a whole compressed file, which is only readable.
The writable part, where you store your data and settings, is stored
in a separated way, inside another file of variable size which you
can store on a usb key or an harddisk. This is a nest.
If the nest you stored is
found by dyne:bolic while booting, then you use its space for
your /home and settings, which are no more lost in volatile RAM at the
next boot.
</para>

<para>
In this way when you upgrade your system you simply have to get
a new dyne:bolic version, all your data is not affected by any
re-installation process and is safely stored in your nest, while
you don't risk to break your operating system with an upgrade
(which is a common case with many other solutions around).
</para>

<para>
A nest is just one single file, the size you want, in a writable partition
of your choice
<footnote><para>
Supported partition formats are: Dos, Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS) and
BSD (UFS), but not NTFS</para>
</footnote>
. Making a nest doesn't
requires any change in the data structure of the partitions: just one
file is created in the root
<footnote><para>
it means the very beginning of a storage unit, like C:\ the drive letter
followed by a single backslash in the DOS filesystem.
</para></footnote>
, it will be called <emphasis>dynebol.nst</emphasis> and will keep all
your home and settings inside (/home and /etc).
</para>

<para>
To get rid of a nest you can simply delete it from a system outside
dyne:bolic. And if you are concerned about the privacy of the data
you store inside it, then you can also make an encrypted nest
<footnote><para>
it is an <emphasis>AES128</emphasis> stream encryption algorithm, way
more secure than usual "security" because <emphasis>all</emphasis> the
data is encoded by your 20 chars long passphrase: is not only about
weak software access policy, see the <ulink url="http://loop-aes.sf.net">
loop-aes</ulink> project.
</para></footnote>
: to activate it you'll be asked by a passphrase at every boot.
</para>

<para>
In dyne:bolic it is very easy to create a nest just with a few clicks
of the mouse, using the graphical installer included: you'll find it
in the menu <emphasis>System -> Nesting</emphasis>.
</para>

<title>Install on harddisk? dock!</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation! you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".
</para>

<para>
Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.
</para>

<para>
In dyne:bolic this only consists of copying one directory from the CD to the harddisk,
you don't need to change anything of your partition, just copy a directory in it:
drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the icon of your harddisk, that's it!
</para>

<para>
However, to do that you need approximately 600 megabytes of free space.
After 'docking', if you boot from the CD it will eject automatically after the
first phase of the boot process, this is the sign the dock went well!
</para>

<para>
The dyne directory consists of a couple of essential files, which can be checked
for integrity using 'md5sum' and 'gpg' on cryptographical signatures of the
mantainer. Do it if you are unsure about their provenience!
</para>

<para>
And of course, when you want to uninstall the dock is as easy:
just delete the /dyne directory in your harddisk!
</para>

<para>
Rembember that docking is different from nesting:
<emphasis>Docking</emphasis> is done to run the system and all application from harddisk instead of cd,
<emphasis>nesting</emphasis> is to store your home and settings in a single file on harddisk or usb storage.
</para>

<para>

</para>

<para>
If you are wondering about this new system of installation:
if it wouldn't be so simple, one could say it was invented on dyne:bolic! ;)
</para>

</section>

<section> <title>Boot from harddisk</title>
<para>
With the procedure described above, we saw that simply moving
a directory in the root of a partition we can boot from CD and
run from harddisk. Ok, what about getting rid of the CD?
Well in fact i hope you give it to somebody else, please
don't waste all that silicium! ;)
</para>
<para>
Anyway, here we go with some instructions - but you gotta be hacking a bit eh!
also browse the dyne:bolic mailinglist archives and eventually
ask there or your closest UNIX Guru for help in understanding.
</para>

<para>
What you have to do is to install a bootloader (Lilo or Grub) on
in a NON-windoz partition on your computer.
If you allready have a GNU/Linux system installed then you have that.
To have a list of your partitions, type as root
<emphasis>>fdisk -l</emphasis>
in a XTERM.
</para>


<para>
In case you have installed lilo, you can
add the following runes to the end of your /etc/lilo.conf file:
<screen>
<userinput>

image = /dyne/linux
  root = /dev/ram0
  initrd = /dyne/initrd.gz
  label = dyne:bolic
  append = "hdd=ide-scsi"
  read-write
  vga = 788

</userinput>
</screen>
Being sure that the /dyne directory is inside the partition
you boot, which in lilo is configured by the
<emphasis>boot = /dev/hd*</emphasis>
usually at the beginning of the lilo.conf file.
</para>

<para>
In case you have grub you should use the following runes in your
/boot/grub/grub.conf file (replacing partition numbers with your
actual ones, see man grub)
<screen>
<userinput>

title dyne:bolic GNU/Linux - RASTASOFT
root (hd0,1) # it is hda2, hda1 is (hd0,0)
kernel /dyne/linux root=/dev/ram0 rw load_ramdisk=1 \
       prompt_ramdisk=0 ramdisk_start=0 vga=788
initrd /dyne/initrd.gz

</userinput>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If you are online and yoy need to install a couple of computers, like
in a media center, you can do it quickly so:
<screen>
<userinput>

# lynx -dump dynebolic.org/lilo.conf >> /etc/lilo.conf

 or

# lynx -dump dynebolic.org/grub.conf >> /boot/grub/grub.conf

</userinput>
</screen>

don't forget to customize the configuration files to fit your needs!
</para>

<para> Happy hacking ;)</para>

<title>Cluster CPU farms</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic Linux kernel allows all the computers running the system on
the same local network to share CPU power by migrating processes from
machines that are working harder to machines that are idle. This
feature is provided to enhance multiprocessing computation on slower
computers: they are then aided by faster computers on the same
network, with a more equitous sharing of common resources.
</para>

<para>
The cluster activates itself at every boot and on every new
configuration of the network card, trying to autodetect other cluster
nodes on the network: the process of sharing CPU power is totally
automated and the groups are formed thru the autodiscovery scan of
each node.
</para>

<para>
Your Dyne:bolic system encloses all the clustering tools in the
filesystem directory <emphasis>/usr/mosix</emphasis>. You can manually
startup the clustering at any time by launching the command
<emphasis>/usr/mosix/openmosix start</emphasis> from an XTERM, while
in that directory you'll also find useful tools to control and gather
information on the way your network cluster works:
<emphasis>mosctl</emphasis> and <emphasis>showmap</emphasis> among the
others; for each you'll find also a man page.
</para>

<para>
This feature is implemented by a kernel patch from the OpenMosix
project, you can know more about this technology and discover about
advanced uses for it on the <ulink
url="http://openmosix.sf.net">OpenMosix webpage</ulink>, where you'll
find extensive documentation and usage guides, while there is also
a useful guide to the use of clustering in dyne:bolic on Spot's perspective
on Technology website <ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=12"></ulink>.

<title>For the curious hacker</title>

<para>
Now if you are wondering what's inside to make it work like it does,
you are very welcome to discover it, dynebolic is free software! and
hackers more familiar with GNU/Linux systems will easily recognize
the architecture.
</para>

<para>
But remember you are on your own in doing so, this documentation is
not about hacking and the author's objective for dynebolic was
to build an environment friendly for the end user, not necessarily
for those who want to modify it. Anyway, if you look for a
customizable bootable cd there are plenty to pick around, Morphix seems to be
a good one to start with.
</para>

<para>
A dyne:bolic SDK is available, it is the one used in development,
and there is a brilliant introduction on how to use it on Spot's site:
<ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=18"></ulink>.
</para>

<para>
You can visit the <ulink url="http://cvs.dyne.org">cvs.dyne.org</ulink>
which is where all dynebolic specific sourcecode is stored and thru all its
development revisions.
