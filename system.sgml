<title>Your desktop environment</title>


<para>
Dyne:bolic doesn't requires to install anything on your harddisks,
which can be left untouched while the system is used. Still, depending
from your preferred way to operate, it can boot from harddisk, CD, USB
or network (explained the following chapter) and it can store data in
a single file that can be transported across different media.  The
whole operating system fits on a single CD, to run it from harddisk
you just need to copy the DYNE directory in it (see docking), while in
a diskless thin-client setup that can also be mounted via network.
This makes dyne:bolic very easy to be employed and mantained, while
there is no risk for misconfiguration: the system comes as it is,
providing a slick desktop full of applications ready to use.  </para>

<para>
The default desktop manager is <ulink
url="http://www.xfce.org">Xfce</ulink>, it offers you multiple
desktops (try ctrl+F2 and other numbers) and a menu that you can
recall by clicking the right mouse button on the background. On the
upper right corner you have your storage devices which you can access
with a click.  </para>

<para>
Inside the application menu software is organized by tasks, so you can
easily find your way to play, record, edit and stream both audio and
video, communicate and publish text, webpages, 3d animations and much
more.  </para>

<para>
Click on <emphasis>CONFIGURE</emphasis> in your menu to access system
configuration facilities and customize your system.  </para>

<para>

You can easily access your files on connected storage devices
(harddisks, cd, floppy, usb) using the buttons in the upper right
corner of your desktop, as well your local network shares and remote
internet accounts.  Your partitions are automatically mounted in the
<emphasis>/mnt</emphasis> directory, which you see linked in your home
as <emphasis>Volumes</emphasis>.  You can read and write on all your
volumes except for NT filesystems, which you can only read.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>usb pendrive</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Usb storage devices (like usb pens, smartcards and some digital photo
cameras) can be opened simply with a double click on the usb symbol.
But beware that sometimes unusual partition schemes can confuse the
autodetection, so you can try by hand in a Xterminal issuing manual
commands:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/usb</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

Where you must substitute X with letters (a,b,c...) and Y with numbers
(1,2,3) for example <emphasis>/dev/sda2</emphasis>.

</para>

<para>
If you have only one cdrom or dvd player on your computer
with <emphasis>docking</emphasis> you can have it free for
use after booting dyne:bolic (see following chapter about DOCKING),
then you can access, browse, play and rip compact discs and dvd.

<title>Nest your home and settings</title>

<para>
By default your <emphasis>/home, /etc and /var</emphasis> directories
reside in RAM memory: every file and configuration you save will not
be there again at the next boot.

To save your home and settings permanently you need to create a
<emphasis>NEST</emphasis>: it is just a file called "dyne.nst" that
can be placed on a harddisk or usb storage device and it loaded at
every boot. You just need to create your nest once, dyne:bolic looks
for it at every startup and if it is present starts using it
automatically.  </para>


<para>
The <emphasis>nesting</emphasis> function is very practical to keep
all the modifications you make to the system while using it (settings,
saved files, accounts, language, private data etc.) and transport or
backup them.  For example, in case you nest on your USB stick, you can
boot with it connected at startup, then that nest will be used and all
your /home and settings will always stay with you, in your personal
USB stick. This way you don't even need a laptop to travel around with
your software environment and data, just carry a dyne:bolic CD and
your nested USB stick with you, wherever you'll be able to boot it
you'll have your /home. </para>

<para>
<emphasis>How to create a nest?</emphasis> at the boot screen or in
your <emphasis>Home</emphasis>, click on the
<emphasis>Configure</emphasis> button, then choose
<emphasis>Nest</emphasis> (the little icon of a duck). You will be
prompted to create a nest on your harddisk or USB stick, proceed
choosing the partition you want and how big you need it: good sizes
may vary between 250 and 500 megabytes, depending from how much you
plan to use the system, modify it and open it for other users.

<para>
Since version 2.4 when creating a nest you'll also see a padlock
button: press it and your new nest will be secured with encryption,
you'll be asked to set a password, which will be then asked at every
boot when you mount the nest.  Without that password it will be very
hard to access your nest, so you'll be granted with fairly good
security for your personal data. 
</para>

<para>
If you nest on harddisk, the supported partition formats are: Dos,
Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS), and NTFS (supported since version
2.5).  The nest is just one file created in the /dyne directory at the
root of your partition (C:\ or D:\ in the DOS filesystem) called
<emphasis>dyne.nst</emphasis>. To erase a nest simply delete that file.

<para>
Since version 2.5 it is also possible to mount nests after boot: just
plug in your usb stick and navigate the content of the dyne/
directory, a double click on the dyne.nst (the duck icon) will mount
your home and prompt for a password if it is encrypted.

<title>Install on harddisk? Dock!</title>

<para>

Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation :) you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".

</para>

<para>

Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.

</para>

<para>

Docking consists of copying the dyne/ directory from the CD to the
harddisk.  You don't need to change anything in your partition, just
copy a directory into it: drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the
icon of your harddisk, that's it!  It will occupy less than 700
megabytes of space.

After 'docking', you can boot with the CD inside and it will eject
automatically after the first phase of the boot process, this is the
sign the dock went well!  Like that, even without the need for
repartitioning or configuring a double boot, you can just switch to
dyne:bolic using a CD or a floppy, but still run it from harddisk at
full speed, like an installed operating system - and even better! ;)

</para>

<para>

Of course when you want to remove the dock is easy: just delete the
/dyne directory in your harddisk!

</para>

<para>

Remember that docking is different from nesting:
<emphasis>Docking</emphasis> is done to run the system and all
application from harddisk instead of CD, <emphasis>nesting</emphasis>
is to store your home and settings in a single file on harddisk or usb
storage.

</para>

<para>

More online information about docking is available on the <ulink
url="http://lab.dyne.org/Docking">wiki community pages</ulink>.

<title>Extra software modules</title>

<indexterm><primary>modules</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Dyne:II offers the possibility to be expanded
using <emphasis>.dyne</emphasis> modules: collections of applications
that can be easily installed and used.  In fact the basic system
already contains some of these modules, that can be found in your dock
as the <emphasis>dyne/modules/</emphasis> directory.

From the menu, you can see them clicking thru <emphasis>CONFIGURE ->
DYNE -> MODULES</emphasis>

</para>

<mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
     <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/shot-modules" format="jpg">
   </imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>

Additional dyne modules are available online on the dynebolic.org
homepage in the <emphasis>Extras</emphasis> section. Download and
activate them just dropping the .dyne files into the
dyne/modules docked directory. Then reboot, that's it!

</para>

<para>

Users can easily keep their modules across different machines, always
finding back the software they need. Modules can also be used thru
different dyne versions: just update the core dock and then drop in
your good old modules.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>pure:dyne</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Download free and open source dyne modules online from
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.dyne.org/dynebolic/modules"</ulink>, there are
many interesting extensions already: office and development tools,
crosscompile chains, manuals and of course games :)
</para>

<para>
Quite some developers and artists are actively contributing with
modules listed
on <ulink url="http://lab.dyne.org/DyneModules"></ulink>.
</para>


<para>

When you install new modules, since it is so easy, the only care that
must be taken is their provenience, since a broken or malicious module
can access all your system. Of course to install a module you must be
root. On our website we'll suggest only modules we have tested, anyway
you're free to choose, it's all up to you to decide whom you trust,
you just did it by running this system on your computer didn't you? :)
