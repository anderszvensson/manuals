<title>Discover the dyne:bolic system</title>

<section>
<title>Your desktop environment</title>


<para>
Dyne:bolic doesn't requires to install anything on your harddisks,
which can be left untouched while the system is used. Still, depending
from your preferred way to operate, it can boot from CD, USB or
harddisk and it can store data in a single file that can be
transported across different media.  The whole operating system fits
on a single CD, to run it from harddisk you just need to copy the
DYNE directory in it (see docking), while in a diskless thin-client
setup that can also be mounted via network.  This makes dyne:bolic
very easy to be employed and mantained, while there is no risk for
misconfiguration: the system comes as it is, providing a slick desktop
full of applications ready to use.  </para>

<para>
The default desktop manager is <ulink
url="http://www.xfce.org">Xfce</ulink>, it offers you multiple
desktops (try ctrl+F2 and other numbers) and a menu that you can
recall by clicking the right mouse button on the background. On the
upper right corner you have your storage devices which you can access
with a click.  </para>

<para>
Inside the application menu software is organized by tasks, so you can
easily find your way to play, record, edit and stream both audio and
video, communicate and publish text, webpages, 3d animations and much
more.  </para>

<para>
Click on <emphasis>CONFIGURE</emphasis> in your menu to access system
configuration facilities and customize your system.  </para>

<para>

You can easily access your files on connected storage devices
(harddisks, cd, floppy, usb) using the buttons in the upper right
corner of your desktop, as well your local network shares and remote
internet accounts.  Your partitions are automatically mounted in the
<emphasis>/mnt</emphasis> directory, which you see linked in your home
as <emphasis>Volumes</emphasis>.  You can read and write on all your
volumes except for NT filesystems, which you can only read.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>usb pendrive</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Usb storage devices (like usb pens, smartcards and some digital photo
cameras) can be opened simply with a double click on the usb symbol.
But beware that sometimes unusual partition schemes can confuse the
autodetection, so you can try by hand in a Xterminal issuing manual
commands:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/usb</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

Where you must substitute X with letters (a,b,c...) and Y with numbers
(1,2,3) for example <emphasis>/dev/sda2</emphasis>.

</para>

<para>
If you have only one cdrom or dvd player on your computer
with <emphasis>docking</emphasis> you can have it free for
use after booting dyne:bolic (see following chapter about DOCKING),
then you can access, browse, play and rip compact discs and dvd.

<title>Nest your home and settings</title>

</mediaobject>



<para>
By default your <emphasis>/home, /etc and /var</emphasis> directories
reside in RAM memory: every file and configuration you save will not
be there again at the next boot.

To save your home and settings permanently you need to create a
<emphasis>NEST</emphasis>: it is just a file called "dyne.nst" that
can be placed on a harddisk or usb storage device and it loaded at
every boot. You just need to create your nest once, dyne:bolic looks
for it at every startup and if it is present starts using it
automatically.  </para>


<para>
The <emphasis>nesting</emphasis> function is very practical to keep
all the modifications you make to the system while using it (settings,
saved files, accounts, language, private data etc.) and transport or
backup them.  For example, in case you nest on your USB stick, you can
boot with it connected at startup, then that nest will be used and all
your /home and settings will always stay with you, in your personal
USB stick. This way you don't even need a laptop to travel around with
your software environment and data, just carry a dyne:bolic CD and
your nested USB stick with you, wherever you'll be able to boot it
you'll have your /home. </para>

<para>
<emphasis>How to create a nest?</emphasis> at the boot screen or in
your <emphasis>Home</emphasis>, click on the
<emphasis>Configure</emphasis> button, then choose
<emphasis>Nest</emphasis> (the little icon of a duck). You will be
prompted to create a nest on your harddisk or USB stick, proceed
choosing the partition you want and how big you need it: good sizes
may vary between 250 and 500 megabytes, depending from how much you
plan to use the system, modify it and open it for other users.
</para>

</mediaobject>


<para>
Since version 2.4 when creating a nest you'll also see a padlock
button: press it and your new nest will be secured with encryption,
you'll be asked to set a password, which will be then asked at every
boot when you mount the nest.  Without that password it will be very
hard to access your nest, so you'll be granted with fairly good
security for your personal data. 
</para>

<para>
If you nest on harddisk, the supported partition formats are: Dos,
Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS), and NTFS (supported since version
2.5).  The nest is just one file created in the /dyne directory at the
root of your partition (C:\ or D:\ in the DOS filesystem) called
<emphasis>dyne.nst</emphasis>. To erase a nest simply delete that file.

<para>
Since version 2.5 it is also possible to mount nests after boot: just
plug in your usb stick and navigate the content of the dyne/
directory, a double click on the dyne.nst (the duck icon) will mount
your home and prompt for a password if it is encrypted.

<title>Install on harddisk? Dock!</title>
<indexterm><primary>docking</primary></indexterm>


<mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
     <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/shot-dock" format="jpg">
   </imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>

Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation :) you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".

</para>

<para>

Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.

</para>

<para>

Docking consists of copying the dyne/ directory from the CD to the
harddisk.  You don't need to change anything in your partition, just
copy a directory into it: drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the
icon of your harddisk, that's it!  It will occupy less than 700
megabytes of space.

After 'docking', you can boot with the CD inside and it will eject
automatically after the first phase of the boot process, this is the
sign the dock went well!  Like that, even without the need for
repartitioning or configuring a double boot, you can just switch to
dyne:bolic using a CD or a floppy, but still run it from harddisk at
full speed, like an installed operating system - and even better! ;)

</para>

<para>

Of course when you want to remove the dock is easy: just delete the
/dyne directory in your harddisk!

</para>

<para>

Remember that docking is different from nesting:
<emphasis>Docking</emphasis> is done to run the system and all
application from harddisk instead of CD, <emphasis>nesting</emphasis>
is to store your home and settings in a single file on harddisk or usb
storage.

</para>

<para>

More online information about docking is available on the <ulink
url="http://lab.dyne.org/Docking">wiki community pages</ulink>.

<title>Extra software modules</title>

<indexterm><primary>modules</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Dyne:II offers the possibility to be expanded using <emphasis>.dyne</emphasis> modules:
collections of applications that can be easily installed and used.  In
fact the basic system already contains some of these modules, that can
be found in your dock as the <emphasis>dyne/modules/</emphasis> directory.

From the menu, you can see them clicking thru <emphasis>CONFIGURE -> DYNE -> MODULES</emphasis>

</para>

<mediaobject>
   <imageobject>
     <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/shot-modules" format="jpg">
   </imageobject>
</mediaobject>

<para>

Additional dyne modules are available online on the dynebolic.org
homepage in the <emphasis>Extras</emphasis> section. Download and
activate them just dropping the .dyne files into the
dyne/modules docked directory. Then reboot, that's it!

</para>

<para>

Users can easily keep their modules across different machines, always
finding back the software they need. Modules can also be used thru
different dyne versions: just update the core dock and then drop in
your good old modules.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>pure:dyne</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Download free and open source dyne modules online from
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.dyne.org/dynebolic/modules"</ulink>, there are
many interesting extensions already: office and development tools,
crosscompile chains, manuals and of course games :)
</para>

<para>
Quite some developers and artists are actively contributing with
modules listed
on <ulink url="http://lab.dyne.org/DyneModules"></ulink>.
</para>


<para>

When you install new modules, since it is so easy, the only care that
must be taken is their provenience, since a broken or malicious module
can access all your system. Of course to install a module you must be
root. On our website we'll suggest only modules we have tested, anyway
you're free to choose, it's all up to you to decide whom you trust,
you just did it by running this system on your computer didn't you? :)

</para>


</section>


<section> <title>Boot from harddisk</title>

<indexterm><primary>boot from harddisk</primary></indexterm>

<para>

With docking we saw that simply moving a directory in the root of a partition
can let us boot from CD and run from harddisk. This is a very simple and safe
way to have a dual-boot system: Cd in for dyne:bolic, CD out for anything else.
Still some people really likes to get rid of the CD, so here it is explained how.

</para>

<para>

Keep in mind that <emphasis>the following operation is not necessary to run dyne:bolic from harddisk</emphasis>.
If you are not familiar with boot sectors and partition geometry you might need the
intervention of an expert when anything goes wrong. Furthermore, in case of a mistake you
might delete all the data stored on your harddisks and/or be left without the possibility
to boot back into your old operating system.

</para>

<para>

In order to boot from harddisk you need a bootloader (Lilo or Grub) installed.
We recommend the use of Grub for its simplicity and flexibility: in fact that
is the default bootloader dyne:bolic will install for you, but in case you have
Lilo already installed and you don't want to change it, then there is also a way
to add a dyne:bolic entry to it.

</para>

<para>

The following instructions will cover various situations: you can omit some operations
in case your computer is already setted up with them.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>partitioning</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>cfdisk</primary></indexterm>
<indexterm><primary>mke3fs</primary></indexterm>

<para>

<emphasis>In case you are installing a computer from scratch</emphasis>, without
anything installed on it yet, then you need to partition the harddisk and format it.
You can do so using the command <emphasis>cfdisk</emphasis> to create or
modify your harddisk partitions, then <emphasis>mke3fs</emphasis> to format the partitions
(or other mk* commands in case you desire to use a different filesystem than Ext3).
<emphasis>Beware that this operation above will erase all the data on the disk</emphasis>.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>grub</primary></indexterm>

<para>

Once you have a disc partitioned and formatted you need to install the bootloader.
To do this use the command <emphasis>grubconfig</emphasis> and follow the steps
you are prompted, at the end of the process you will be able to boot your computer
directly into dyne:bolic, without the need to use a CD.

</para>


<para>

<emphasis>To re-configure your bootloader</emphasis> (not necessary if
you installed one from scratch using dyne:bolic) go look into your harddisk
partitions, in case you have a directory boot/ see if inside there is another
directory called grub/, if yes there you found your grub configuration, a simple text file
called grub.conf or menu.lst which you have to edit by hand, adding a
few lines at the bottom in order to add dyne:bolic among the boot menu
selection:

<screen>
<userinput>
title dyne:bolic RASTASOFT Afro Linux
root (hd0,0) # ADJUST THIS!
kernel /dyne/2618ck1d.krn root=/dev/ram0 rw load_ramdisk=1 max_loop=64 vga=791
initrd /dyne/initrd.gz
</userinput>
</screen>

After doing that you'll need to set the harddisk where you have
docked: where it says "ADJUST THiS" change the
<emphasis>(hd0,0)</emphasis> if necessary: hd0,1 for hda2 - hd0,2 for
hda3 - hd1,0 for hdb1 and so on... trying wrong values is not
dangerous and in case you are confused there is a lot more
documentation about this process in the grub manual pages.

</para>

<indexterm><primary>lilo</primary></indexterm>

<para>

In case you have installed lilo, search among your harddisk partitions
for the directory etc/ and then inside for the lilo.conf file, if
found then add the following lines at the end of it:

<screen>
<userinput>

image = /dyne/2618ck1d.krn
  root = /dev/ram0
  append = "max_loop=64"
  initrd = /dyne/initrd.gz
  label = dyne
  read-write
  vga = 791

</userinput>
</screen>

Being sure that the /dyne directory is inside the partition
you boot, which in lilo is configured by the
<emphasis>boot = /dev/hd*</emphasis>
usually at the beginning of the lilo.conf file.

Please note the "image =" parameter takes a full path to
the kernel file, which is named after it's version in a condensed form,
for instance here 2618ck1d stands for 2.6.18-ck1-dyne .
The condensed format is necessary for a 8.3 filename restriction of
the isolinux CD boot system.

<section> <title>Boot from network</title>

<indexterm><primary>boot from network</primary></indexterm>

<para>
Network booting is supported on some personal computers: the PXE
system was included on some BIOS already at the beginning of year 2000
(rough estimation): if no harddisks or cd devices are found to boot,
the first black screen of the computer will search for a PXE boot on
the local network.
</para>

<para>
When booting PXE looks for a DHCP server on the local network for an
address assigned. When found it will connect via TFTP to receive the
kernel and the ramdisk from that server or another one.
</para>

<para>
To start a TFTP server distributing the current docked dyne:bolic system, it
is enough to run this command in a terminal:
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>tftpd -l -s $DYNE_SYS_MNT</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
You can also configure a DHCP server to provide the network addresses
to any PXE client booting. To do that use the graphical program
<emphasis>gdhcpd</emphasis> starting it from a terminal, or the sample
configuration file in /etc/dhcpd.conf. See <emphasis>man
dhcpd</emphasis> for a reference to how to launch and operate the DHCP
daemon.
</para>

<para>
For more informations see <emphasis>man tftpd</emphasis> and
<emphasis>man dhcpd</emphasis>.

<title>Keep your data safe</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic is developed with your privacy in mind: as mentioned before
the NEST can be encrypted to make your private data unaccessible
unless your password is provided, now we'll proceed to analize in deep
all the aspects of this security measure.
</para>


<para>
When an encrypted nest is created, every file you place in your home
directory will be preserved in a scrambled form using a
Rijndael/SHA256 algorithm: such a cypher can be considered very
secure, maybe some military organizations are able to break it, but
anyway that would be very expensive in terms of resources employed.
</para>

<para>
Dyne:bolic encryption mechanism employes a passfile "dyne.nst.gpg"
which contains the cypher used to protect your data: that file holds
the password that, matched together with your dyne.nst file, can
access all the data you store in your nest. So actually that file is
very precious for your privacy, you should be careful and not copy it
around.
</para>

<para>
Since the passfile is so delicate, it is also protected with a
password: the one you choose at the beginning, which is used to
scramble the passfile through a CAT5 algorithm. Keep in mind that this
cypher algorithm is weak and eventually, in case an intruder takes
possession of your .gpg passfile, it will be easy to crack.
</para>

<para>
Now in practical terms all this encryption scheme means that you can
safely move around your dyne.nst file separated from the dyne.nst.gpg
passfile: there will be no intrusion in the data stored inside even in
case you loose it. It also means that you can give your passfile to a
friend, still protected by the password you memorized, so that neither
you nor your friend will be able to access the nest until you meet up
again. More in general, this scheme lets you separate your encrypted
data from the passfile, still keeping everything sealed by the
password you keep in mind, and move the data around in different
places being sure meanwhile it's not accessed by anyone else.
</para>

<para>
So for sure we can say our privacy protection is way above the usual
schemes used in most common operating systems, which keep your data in
clear and physically accessible.
  </para>

<para>
In case you are involved in some mission critical task and you are
facing the possibility of imprisonment and torture, you should take a
bit more care. A good practice would be to customize a bit the startup
scripts of dyne:bolic to have a false password prompt, the
/lib/dyne/nest.sh script is a good start.  Another way can be to have
an encrypted nest for which you would disclose the password if forced
to, but then also another encrypted file hidden somewhere that is not
prompting for a password at every boot.
</para>

<section>
<title>Cluster computer farms</title>

<para>
Since version 2, dyne:bolic changes its approach to clustering
implementing a "human driven" suite of tools that let you control
various applications running on multiple computers connected to
your network.
</para>

<para>
In situations where you have many old computers you can use one for
each task and control all of them from the same keyboard and mouse.
The desktops of the computers can be visualized on your own screen or
on multiple screens in case you have monitors attached to each of
them. Powerful workstations can be combined using multiple processing
units and their displays can be tiled together to compose a unique
wide desktop.
</para>


<para>
This way to operate dyne:bolic computers involves different kinds of
applications offering a flexible setup that you can customize to your
needs. This part of the manual will just make you familiar with the
tools and you'll need to refer to their manuals to discover all the
potential.
</para>

<para>
To connect multiple computers you should first make sure you can reach
them over the network and you know their addresses. A simple way to do
it that will work on every GNU/Linux system is using the
command <emphasis>ifconfig</emphasis> on each computer to print out
the currently configured network address:
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>ifconfig | grep inet
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
then edit your <emphasis>/etc/hosts</emphasis> file with the full list
of addresses and a name for them that you can choose. Copying the /etc/hosts file on all involved machines will make them aware of each other "hostnames".
</para>


<para>
<emphasis>Synergy</emphasis> is a powerful tool that lets your
keyboard and mouse control different desktops accessed simply moving
the mouse out of the current screen into theirs. An example
configuration file is provided
in <emphasis>/etc/synergy.conf</emphasis> and it must be modified
with the hostnames of your computers (to be associated to IP numeric
addresses in /etc/hosts).


<para>
The main computer where the keyboard and mouse are attached should run
the command:
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>synergys -n hostname -c /etc/synergy.conf
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

All the other computers to be connected should run this command,
making sure the config file include them in the setup:
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>synergyc -n hostname -c /etc/synergy.conf
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>VNC</emphasis> is a remote video client that lets you
control the desktop of another computer on your network as inside a
window on your current desktop. It can be also used to interact with
two mouse and keyboard at the same time.
</para>

<para>
To share the desktop of a computer for an incoming VNC connection just
run:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>x11vnc
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

To connect to a computer sharing the VNC desktop:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>vncviewer computer
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

For more informations on VNC see <emphasis>man x11vnc</emphasis> and
<emphasis>man vncviewer</emphasis>.
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Remote X</emphasis> execution lets you run an application on
another computer and control it on your desktop, as if it would be
running locally.
</para>

<para>
In order to authorize other computers to open applications on your
desktop you must first run the command:
<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>xhost +computer
</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

Then Click the network button on the top-right panel and
run <emphasis>Exec_X11</emphasis>, fill in your user account (default
is user:root password:luther) and write the command to start the application.
</para>
