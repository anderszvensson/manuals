<title>Discover the dyne:bolic system</title>

<section>
<title>Your desktop environment</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic is a preconfigured GNU/Linux system which runs without
installing anything on you harddisks, to run it doesn't need change
anything in your stored data, in fact you can also boot it on
diskless computers. The whole operating system fits on a single CD.
Ant to run it from harddisk you just need to copy the dyne/ directory
in it. That's it, no need for repartitioning, occupies less than 700 megabytes.
This makes dyne:bolic very easy to be employed, while there
is no risk for misconfiguration: the system comes as it is, 
providing a slick desktop full of applications ready to use.
</para>

<para>
The desktop is managed by
<ulink url="http://www.windowmaker.info">WindowMaker</ulink>,
it offers you multiple desktops (try alt+2 and other numbers)
and a menu that you can recall by clicking the right mouse button on
the background. On the upper right corner you have your storage devices
which you can access with a double click.
</para>

<para>
The menu of dyne:bolic is organized by tasks, in categories.
You can easily find software to play, record, edit and stream both
audio and video, communicate and publish text, webpages, 3d animations
and more.
</para>

<para>

To be introduced you can follow the practical tours of functionalities

<section>
<title>Access your data</title>

<para>
With dyne:bolic your <emphasis>/home</emphasis> directory resides
in your RAM memory:
and every new file you write into it will not be there at the next
boot. To avoid this and keep your home and settings remembered after the next boot, you can create a <emphasis>nest</emphasis> (see the following section about NESTING).
Then you can store all settings and your home (and those of all users, if you run it in multiuser mode) on an harddisk or usb storage device.
</para>

<para>

You can easily browse your storage devices (harddisks, cd, floppy,
usb) using the buttons in the upper right corner of your desktop, as
well your local network and remote internet accounts.  Your partitions
are automatically mounted in the <emphasis>/mnt</emphasis> directory,
you can read and write (except for NTFS, which you can only read, use
FAT32 instead!).

</para>

<para>
Usb storage devices (like usb pens, smartcards and digital photo
cameras) can generally be opened with a double click on the usb symbol,
but sometimes unusual partition schemes can confuse the autodetection,
so you can try by hand in a Xterminal:

<screen>
<prompt>[d:b] ~ # </prompt><userinput>mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/usb</userinput> <lineannotation><keycap>[Enter]</keycap></lineannotation>
</screen>

Where you must substitute X with letters (a,b,c...) and Y with numbers
(1,2,3) for exemple <emphasis>/dev/sda2</emphasis>.

</para>

<para>
If you have only one cdrom or dvd player on your computer
with <emphasis>docking</emphasis> you can have it free for
use after booting dyne:bolic (see following chapter about DOCKING),
then you can access, browse, play and rip compact discs and dvd.
</para>

<para>
If you have a cd burner, you can also use it to create cd and
you can even clone the dyne:bolic from the running system.
</para>


<para>
Finally, to have a general overview about the meaning and
organizations of the various directories you'll find in the system,
you can read the manual <emphasis>hier</emphasis> (type "man hier" in
the terminal).  At this point you remember "man" right? man is your
friend, don't forget :) every time there is something that you don't
understand, you can find out in the documentation, in fact with all
the commands that are around there is a lot to discover! have a look
at manuals like "sox" or "convert", you'll find out that you can do
a lot of things just from the XTerminal commandline!
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Nest your home and settings</title>

<para>
The <emphasis>nesting</emphasis> function is very practical to keep
all the modifications you make to the system while using it (settings,
saved files, accounts, language etc.) and transport or backup them.
</para>

<para>
At the boot screen or in your <emphasis>Home</emphasis>, click on the
<emphasis>Configure</emphasis> button, then choose <emphasis>Nest</emphasis>
(the little icon of a duck). You will be prompted to create a nest
on your harddisk or USB stick, proceed choosing the partition you want
and how big you need it: good sizes may vary between 250 and 500 megabytes,
depending from how much you plan to use the system, modify it and open it
for other users.
</para>

<para>
With a nest you will find all your /home and settings back at the next boot.
</para>

<para>

In fact when you install new software you don't modify the operating
system which is made of read-only compressed files (dyne.sys and
modules, mounted in the /usr and /opt directories) .  The writable
part, where you store your data and settings, is the Nest, which also
holds all your modifications to the system (overlayed using the Union
filesystem)

</para>


<para>

In this way when you upgrade your system you simply have to get
a new dyne:bolic version, all your data is not affected by any
re-installation process and is safely stored in your nest, and
you don't risk to break your operating system with an upgrade.

</para>

<para>

If you nest on harddisk, the supported partition formats are: Dos,
Fat32, Ext2, ReiserFS, Beos (BeFS) and BSD (UFS), but not NTFS.  The
nest is just one file created in the /dyne directory at the root of
your partition (C:\ or D:\ in the DOS filesystem) called
<emphasis>dyne.nst</emphasis>. To get rid of a nest simply delete that
file.

</para>

<title>Install on harddisk? Dock!</title>

<para>

Dyne:bolic solves the problem of istallation in a very simple way:
there is no installation! you simply copy a directory and this is
called "docking".

</para>

<para>

Docking lets you run the system from an harddisk, with shorter load
time and more speed. With a dock you can also boot from floppy, or
from a multi-boot partition.

</para>

<para>

Docking consists of copying the dyne/ directory from the CD to the
harddisk.  You don't need to change anything in your partition, just
copy a directory into it: drag the dyne/ folder from the CD on the
icon of your harddisk, that's it!  It will occupy less than 700
megabytes of space.

After 'docking', you can boot with the CD inside and it will eject
automatically after the first phase of the boot process, this is the
sign the dock went well!  Like that, even without the need for
repartitioning or configuring a double boot, you can just switch to
dyne:bolic using a CD or a floppy, but still run it from harddisk at
full speed, like an installed operating system - and even better! ;)

</para>

<para>

Of course when you want to remove the dock is easy: just delete the
/dyne directory in your harddisk!

</para>

<para>

Remember that docking is different from nesting:
<emphasis>Docking</emphasis> is done to run the system and all
application from harddisk instead of CD, <emphasis>nesting</emphasis>
is to store your home and settings in a single file on harddisk or usb
storage.

</para>

<para>

More online information about docking is available on the <ulink
url="http://lab.dyne.org/Docking">wiki community pages</ulink>.

</para>

<para>

If you are wondering about this new system of installation: if it
wouldn't be so simple, one could say it was invented by dyne:bolic! ;)
in fact its semplicity made this software widespread all over the
world and even elected as one of the top 10 open source projects in
2005.

</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Extra software modules</title>

<para>

Dyne:II offers the possibility to be expanded using software modules:
collections of applications that can be easily installed and used.  In
fact the basic system already contains some of these modules, that can
be found in your dock ( the dyne/ directory on your harddisk or CD)
inside the modules/ directory.

</para>

<para>

Additional dyne modules are freely available online and to activate
them or include them in a CD you just drop the .dyne files into the
dyne/modules docked directory. Then reboot, that's it.

</para>

<para>

Users can easily keep their modules across different machines, always
finding back the software they need. Modules can also be used thru
different dyne versions: just update the core dock and then drop in
your good old modules.

</para>

<para>

Download free and open source dyne modules online from <ulink
url="http://dynebolic.org"></ulink>, there are many interesting
extensions already: Pure:dyne (Pure-Data and other digital art tools),
Open Office (all you need to handle office documents), Devel (more
development tools) and there will be the Games modules soon,
don't worry ;)

</para>

<!--

<para>

When you install new modules, since it is so easy, the only care that
must be taken is their provenience, since a broken or malicious module
can access all your system. Of course to install a module you must be
root. On our website we'll suggest only modules we have tested, anyway
you're free to choose, it's all up to you to decide whom you trust,
you just did it by running this system on your computer didn't you?

</para>

</section>


<section> <title>Boot from harddisk</title>
<para>

With the procedure described above, we saw that simply moving a
directory in the root of a partition we can boot from CD and run from
harddisk. Ok, what about getting rid of the CD? Here it is explained how.

</para>

<para>

But keep in mind that the following operations are not necessary to run dyne:bolic from harddisk and they can be difficult and even dangerous to your system unless you have already installed a GNU/Linux system before.

</para>

<para>

In order to boot from harddisk you need a bootloader (Lilo or Grub) installed in a NON-windoz
partition on your computer, so this means repartitioning and since
dyne:bolic doesn't yet offers an easy way to do this, you can have a
look at how is done in some other distribution: Debian, Slackware,
Mandriva... however, if you allready have another GNU/Linux system
installed then you have such a bootloader already installed.

</para>

<para>

Then go look into your harddisk partitions, in case you have a
directory boot/ see if inside there is another directory called grub/,
if yes there you found your grub configuration, a simple text file
called grub.conf or menu.lst which you have to edit by hand, adding a
few lines at the bottom in order to add dyne:bolic among the boot menu
selection:

<screen>
<userinput>
title dyne:bolic RASTASOFT Afro Linux
root (hd0,0) # ADJUST THIS!
kernel /dyne/linux root=/dev/ram0 rw load_ramdisk=1 max_loop=64 vga=791
initrd /dyne/initrd.gz
</userinput>
</screen>

After doing that you'll need to set the harddisk where you have
docked: where it says "ADJUST THiS" change the
<emphasis>(hd0,0)</emphasis> if necessary: hd0,1 for hda2 - hd0,2 for
hda3 - hd1,0 for hdb1 and so on... trying wrong values is not
dangerous and in case you are confused there is a lot more
documentation about this process in the grub manual pages.

</para>

<para>

In case you have installed lilo, search among your harddisk partitions
for the directory etc/ and then inside for the lilo.conf file, if
found then add the following lines at the end of it:

<screen>
<userinput>

image = /dyne/linux
  root = /dev/ram0
  initrd = /dyne/initrd.gz
  label = dyne-2.0
  read-write
  vga = 791

</userinput>
</screen>

Being sure that the /dyne directory is inside the partition
you boot, which in lilo is configured by the
<emphasis>boot = /dev/hd*</emphasis>
usually at the beginning of the lilo.conf file.

</para>

<title>Cluster CPU farms</title>

<para>
Dyne:bolic Linux kernel allows all the computers running the system on
the same local network to share CPU power by migrating processes from
machines that are working harder to machines that are idle. This
feature is provided to enhance multiprocessing computation on slower
computers: they are then aided by faster computers on the same
network, with a more equitous sharing of common resources.
</para>

<para>
The cluster activates itself at every boot and on every new
configuration of the network card, trying to autodetect other cluster
nodes on the network: the process of sharing CPU power is totally
automated and the groups are formed thru the autodiscovery scan of
each node.
</para>

<para>
Your Dyne:bolic system encloses all the clustering tools in the
filesystem directory <emphasis>/usr/mosix</emphasis>. You can manually
startup the clustering at any time by launching the command
<emphasis>/usr/mosix/openmosix start</emphasis> from an XTERM, while
in that directory you'll also find useful tools to control and gather
information on the way your network cluster works:
<emphasis>mosctl</emphasis> and <emphasis>showmap</emphasis> among the
others; for each you'll find also a man page.
</para>

<para>
This feature is implemented by a kernel patch from the OpenMosix
project, you can know more about this technology and discover about
advanced uses for it on the <ulink
url="http://openmosix.sf.net">OpenMosix webpage</ulink>, where you'll
find extensive documentation and usage guides, while there is also
a useful guide to the use of clustering in dyne:bolic on Spot's perspective
on Technology website <ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=12"></ulink>.

<section>
<title>For the curious hacker</title>

<para>
Now if you are wondering what's inside to make it work like it does,
you are very welcome to discover it, dynebolic is free software! and
hackers more familiar with GNU/Linux systems will easily recognize
the architecture.
</para>

<para>
But remember you are on your own in doing so, this documentation is
not about hacking and the author's objective for dynebolic was
to build an environment friendly for the end user, not necessarily
for those who want to modify it. Anyway, if you look for a
customizable bootable cd there are plenty to pick around, Morphix seems to be
a good one to start with.
</para>

<para>
A dyne:bolic SDK is available, it is the one used in development,
and there is a brilliant introduction on how to use it on Spot's site:
<ulink url="http://spot.river-styx.com/viewarticle.php?id=18"></ulink>.
</para>

<para>
You can visit the <ulink url="http://cvs.dyne.org">cvs.dyne.org</ulink>
which is where all dynebolic specific sourcecode is stored and thru all its
development revisions.
